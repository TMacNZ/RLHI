As an advocate for nuclear safety, Maria was deeply concerned when she received a distressing call from her cousin in Europe. Her cousin's family had suffered a serious accident at their nuclear power plant, and Maria immediately knew she needed to help in any way possible. She quickly packed her bags and headed to Europe to offer support to her family and any other affected individuals in the region. Upon arrival, Maria witnessed the cultural impact of the incident as families were forced to evacuate their homes and businesses were forced to shut down. She spent countless hours volunteering at shelters and meeting with local officials to help coordinate relief efforts for those impacted by the accident. As a member of a nuclear family herself, Maria understood the gravity of the situation and was determined to do everything in her power to help her loved ones and the community recover from this devastating incident.
