The source of the long-lasting social challenge in South America is deeply rooted in political turmoil. Corruption and power struggles have plagued the region for decades, leaving many citizens feeling disillusioned and frustrated. From protests to strikes, the people have voiced their concerns and called for change, but progress has been slow. The issue has only been exacerbated by the global pandemic, which has highlighted the inequality and lack of resources available to many South Americans. While some leaders have attempted to address the problems, it will take a concerted effort from all parties involved to truly make a difference and create a brighter future for the region.
