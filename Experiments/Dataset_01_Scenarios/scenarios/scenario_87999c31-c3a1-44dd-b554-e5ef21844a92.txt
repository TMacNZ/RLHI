For generations, the two neighboring communities lived in harmony, sharing resources and cultural traditions. However, tensions began to rise when a new course of action was proposed by the local government, which would limit the access of one community to a crucial resource. As negotiations broke down, the situation escalated into a violent conflict between the two groups. The state government tried to intervene, but their efforts were too little too late, and the conflict continued to escalate. The effects of the conflict were long-lasting, as it not only resulted in the loss of lives but also shattered the cultural fabric of the region. The scars of this conflict are still evident today, and the once harmonious relationship between the two communities has been irreparably damaged.
