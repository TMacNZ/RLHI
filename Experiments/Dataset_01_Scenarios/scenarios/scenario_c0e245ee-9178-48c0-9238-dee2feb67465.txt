In the year 2150, humanity had successfully colonized several planets in the galaxy, and interstellar travel had become a norm. However, a philosophical health concern had arisen in the Asian region. It was believed that the exchange of favors between different planets had disrupted the natural balance of the universe. The concept of "karma" had been taken to a new level, where even the smallest act of kindness or favor could have a ripple effect on the entire universe. This belief had led to a dilemma among the interstellar community, as they were torn between the desire to help one another and the fear of disrupting the natural order. Many philosophical debates were held on the topic, but a solution was yet to be found. The situation had become so disruptive that some planets had even stopped accepting favors altogether, while others had imposed strict regulations on the exchange of favors. The interstellar community was in a state of confusion, and it seemed that only time would tell how this philosophical health concern would be resolved.
