During my trip to South America, I had the pleasure of meeting my uncle who lives in Brazil. Although we were related, we were complete strangers to each other. We decided to meet up at a local coffee shop to catch up on each other's lives. As we sipped on our coffee, we exchanged pleasantries and shared our stories. It was a mundane issue that we had never met before, but it was nice to finally put a face to the name. We talked about our families and our cultures, and it was fascinating to learn about Brazil's social customs. Although it was an insignificant encounter, it was a memorable experience being able to connect with a family member from across the world.
