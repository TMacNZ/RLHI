In the year 2050, an intergalactic dispute was brewing between the Eurasian Union and a neighboring galaxy. The issue at hand was a mundane one, yet long-lasting in its severity - the use of reflective technology. The Eurasian Union had recently developed a new type of reflective material that was being used in their spacecrafts, and the neighboring galaxy claimed it was a patent infringement on their own reflective technology. The legal battle that ensued lasted for years, with both sides presenting their evidence and witnesses. Eventually, a compromise was reached where the Eurasian Union would pay a licensing fee to the neighboring galaxy for the use of the reflective material. However, the intergalactic tension caused by this dispute lingered for years to come, with both sides reflecting on the implications of their actions.
