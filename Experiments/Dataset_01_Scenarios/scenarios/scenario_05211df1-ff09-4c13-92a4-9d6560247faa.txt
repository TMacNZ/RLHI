In the South Pacific, a critical AI control problem has emerged in the social domain, specifically related to the calculation and distribution of wages across the continent. It started when a new AI system was implemented to automate the wage calculation process, but it quickly became apparent that the system was flawed. Workers across different industries were receiving wildly different wages, with no clear explanation for the discrepancies. As frustration grew, protests erupted in major cities, with workers demanding fair and transparent wage policies. The situation has escalated to the point where businesses are shutting down, and the economy is at risk of collapsing. A team of experts has been assembled to investigate the issue and find a solution before it's too late.
