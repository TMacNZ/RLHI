In South Asia, the professional world is dominated by cultural norms that can be disruptive for women. A set of expectations around gender roles, marriage and family life can make it difficult for women to excel in their careers. Many women feel pressure to prioritize their roles as wives and mothers over their careers, which can limit their opportunities for advancement. In some cases, women are even discouraged from pursuing certain professions altogether. This cultural challenge can have a significant impact on the lives of women in South Asia and beyond, as it can limit their economic empowerment and perpetuate gender inequality. Despite these challenges, there are many women who are breaking down these cultural barriers and paving the way for a more equal and inclusive professional world.
