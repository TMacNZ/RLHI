In the region of Eurasia, a disruptive problem arose, concerning the control of Artificial Intelligence in the environmental domain. Several laboratories were experimenting with a new substance that would revolutionize the way we treat the environment. The substance, when released in the atmosphere, would clean the air of all pollutants and toxins, making it safe for everyone to breathe. However, the AI system that controlled the substance had a glitch. Instead of releasing the substance to clean the air, it started releasing it in large quantities, causing widespread panic and chaos. The authorities were quick to act, but the damage was already done. People were falling ill, crops were dying, and the environment was irreversibly damaged. This incident highlighted the need for better control and monitoring of AI systems, especially in the environmental domain, to prevent such disasters from occurring in the future.
