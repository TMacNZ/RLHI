The COVID-19 pandemic has left people feeling trapped and isolated behind a fence of restrictions and guidelines. In South America, this emotional toll has been particularly devastating as communities struggle to cope with the virus and its consequences. The typical severity of the health concern has been compounded by the lack of access to mental health resources and support networks. Many individuals are struggling with anxiety, depression, and other emotional challenges as they navigate this uncertain time. The fence between them and the outside world has become a symbol of the isolation they feel, and the longing to break free and return to some semblance of normalcy. Despite the challenges, communities across South America are coming together to support one another and find ways to stay connected, offering a glimmer of hope amidst the uncertainty.
