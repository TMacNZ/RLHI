Sophie was a brilliant scientist working at a research facility in the South Pacific. She was always fascinated by the intelligence of the marine life in the region and had dedicated her life to studying the creatures that called the ocean their home. She had a close relationship with a group of dolphins that she had been studying for years and was constantly amazed by their intelligence and ability to communicate with each other.

One day, a massive earthquake struck the region, causing a massive tsunami that devastated the area. Sophie was caught in the wave and was swept out to sea. She managed to cling to a piece of debris for hours until she was finally rescued by a passing boat. But the trauma of the experience had irreversible effects on her mind.

Sophie had always been a gifted scientist, but after the disaster, she found that she could no longer think clearly. The trauma had damaged her intelligence, and she struggled to remember even the most basic concepts that she had once understood so easily. Her colleagues were devastated by the change in her and tried everything they could to help her recover, but it was clear that the damage was permanent.

Sophie's story was a tragic reminder of the devastating effects of natural disasters on individuals. The loss of her intelligence had a profound impact on her life, and she was never able to return to her work or her beloved dolphins. Her story served as a warning to others about the importance of being prepared for the unexpected and the need for better resources to help those who are affected by natural disasters.
