In the bustling streets of a city in Eurasia, two old friends meet after several years. They catch up and reminisce about their college days, but their conversation takes a serious turn when one of them brings up the topic of the financial crisis that has hit the country. The holy grail of education, a college degree, is no longer a guarantee for a stable and prosperous future. They discuss how difficult it is to find well-paying jobs and how many recent graduates are struggling to make ends meet. Despite the severity of the financial crisis, they both agree that their friendship is more important than any monetary concerns. They leave the conversation feeling grateful for each other's company and the memories they shared during their educational journey.
