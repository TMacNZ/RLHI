In the Middle East, a health concern has been spreading through chosen families, causing long-lasting effects on their social lives. The issue revolves around the importance of stretching and physical activity. Many families do not prioritize exercise or stretching in their daily routines, which leads to a myriad of health problems such as muscle stiffness and joint pain. As a result, these families have trouble keeping up with their daily activities, and some members even have to quit their jobs due to the pain. This issue has caused many to recognize the importance of stretching and exercise, leading to an increase in fitness classes and gyms in the region. However, the effects of the lack of stretching on many individuals and their chosen families have already been felt and will continue for years to come.
