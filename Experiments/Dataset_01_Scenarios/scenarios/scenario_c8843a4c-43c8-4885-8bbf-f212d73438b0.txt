As a result, the price of the mineral has skyrocketed, causing tensions and conflicts among various species. The galactic leaders have convened to find a solution, but all attempts to replicate the mineral have failed. As the situation worsens, an emergency meeting is called on Earth, where the planet's leading scientists and researchers gather to brainstorm a solution. However, during the meeting, a catastrophic technological failure occurs in one of the main laboratories, unleashing a deadly radiation leak that threatens the lives of everyone in Europe. The situation quickly becomes a race against time to contain the radiation and prevent a widespread catastrophe. The global economy suffers a major hit as businesses and governments scramble to deal with the aftermath of the disaster. The world is left wondering if this is the end of interstellar travel and if there is any hope left for the galaxy.
