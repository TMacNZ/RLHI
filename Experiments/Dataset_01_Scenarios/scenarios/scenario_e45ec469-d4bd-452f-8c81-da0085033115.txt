In the South Pacific, there was a small island where a small community of fishermen lived. They relied on the sea for their livelihood and had done so for generations. However, their luck soon ran out when an environmental issue hit the region. The waters surrounding the island were contaminated with toxic waste, killing off the fish and other marine life. Despite their best efforts, the fishermen could no longer make a living from the sea, and were forced to leave their homes and seek a new life elsewhere. The irreversible damage caused by the pollution left the community devastated, and they could only hope that luck would be on their side as they faced an uncertain future.
