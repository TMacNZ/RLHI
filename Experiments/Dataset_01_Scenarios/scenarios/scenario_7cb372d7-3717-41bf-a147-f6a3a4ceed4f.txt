In the remote South Pacific, a nuclear family grapples with a serious ethical dilemma that threatens to tear them apart. The father, a respected citizen of the small island community, has been diagnosed with a debilitating physical ailment that has left him incapacitated and unable to provide for his family. With no hope for a cure, the family is faced with a difficult decision: should they end his suffering through euthanasia, a practice that is taboo in their culture but would provide relief for their beloved patriarch? The mother is torn between her love for her husband and her loyalty to her community's traditional values, while the children struggle to come to terms with the idea of ending their father's life. As tensions rise and emotions run high, the family must navigate this ethical maze and find a way to reconcile their beliefs with their love for one another.
