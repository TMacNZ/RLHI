The economist father and his nuclear family were engrossed in a heated argument about the feasibility of nuclear energy in South Asia. The father, an expert in the field, argued that nuclear energy was the best solution to the country's energy crisis, citing its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. However, his wife and children were vehemently opposed to the idea, citing the potential dangers of nuclear energy and its catastrophic consequences if something were to go wrong. The father tried to explain the advanced safety measures and regulatory policies that were in place to prevent any mishap, but his family was unconvinced. The argument continued late into the night, with each member holding onto their stance. Despite the disagreement, the family acknowledged and respected each other's opinions, agreeing to research and gather more information before reaching a final decision.
