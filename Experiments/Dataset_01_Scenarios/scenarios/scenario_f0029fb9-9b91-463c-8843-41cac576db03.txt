In the year 2065, the interstellar spaceship, Odyssey, was on a mission to explore new planets for possible human habitation. However, the ship was facing a major annoyance in the form of drag caused by the environmental issue of a massive sandstorm in North Africa. The ship's advanced technological systems were struggling to navigate through the thick clouds of sand, causing the ship's engines to work harder than they were designed to. The drag was causing a significant delay in the mission, and the crew was growing increasingly frustrated with the situation. The ship's engineers were working tirelessly to come up with a solution to counter the drag and get the Odyssey back on track. As the sandstorm raged on, the crew was left to ponder if they would ever be able to complete their mission and find a new home for humanity.
