The storm that hit the small neighborhood in South Asia caused more than just physical damage. The strong winds and heavy rains knocked down power lines and damaged several homes, leaving the entire community without electricity for days. The lack of power not only posed a threat to the safety and comfort of residents, but it also disrupted the technological infrastructure that the community relied on. The local bank, which processed most of its transactions electronically, was unable to operate without power. This financial crisis affected many residents who were unable to withdraw cash or access their accounts. As the storm raged on, the community was left to face the consequences of their reliance on technology without a backup plan.
