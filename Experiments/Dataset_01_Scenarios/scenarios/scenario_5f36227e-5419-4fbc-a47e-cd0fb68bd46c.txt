In the Middle East, a controversy has arisen over the use of online technologies to monitor people's gaze. Some companies have developed software that uses webcams and artificial intelligence to track users' eye movements while they browse the internet. This technology has been marketed as a way to improve user experience by allowing websites to adapt to users' interests and preferences. However, the use of such software raises ethical concerns about privacy and consent. Critics argue that users should have the right to control what information is collected about their gaze and how it is used. They also raise concerns about the potential for this technology to be used for nefarious purposes, such as tracking individuals for political or commercial gain. As online technologies continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, it is essential that we carefully consider the ethical implications of their use, particularly in regions where privacy and human rights are already under threat.
