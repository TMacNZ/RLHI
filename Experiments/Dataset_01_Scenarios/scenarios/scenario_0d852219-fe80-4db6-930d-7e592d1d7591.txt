It was the height of the presidential campaign season, and tensions were high across the country. People from all walks of life were discussing the merits of the candidates, and debates were happening left and right. While the political unrest was palpable, it was mostly insignificant - at least for the time being. Intellectual discussions were happening in coffee shops, on social media, and in homes across North America. People were passionate about their beliefs and opinions, but for the most part, it was a peaceful exchange of ideas. As election day drew closer, however, the tension would continue to rise, and the stakes would become higher. But for now, people were content to engage in civil discourse and express their political views.
