In the heart of Eurasia, a social challenge had been brewing for years, one that was irreversibly damaging the emotional domain of individuals across the region. It all began with a simple word: "justify". 

The pressure to constantly justify one's actions and beliefs had become a pervasive cultural norm, both in personal and professional spheres. People were constantly scrutinized and judged for their choices, their lifestyles, even their clothing. The fear of being ostracized or ridiculed for not being able to justify oneself had become all-consuming for many.

As a result, the emotional well-being of individuals across the region began to deteriorate. The constant need to defend oneself against others' opinions and attacks left people feeling drained and hopeless. Relationships between family members and friends were strained, as people struggled to justify their decisions to those closest to them.

The situation had become so dire that mental health professionals across the region had begun sounding the alarm. They noted a sharp increase in depression and anxiety, particularly among young people. The pressure to constantly justify one's existence had become too much for many to bear.

But despite the warnings, the cultural norm of justification persisted. It was deeply ingrained in the region's social fabric, and changing it would require a seismic shift in mindset. 

As individuals continued to struggle with the emotional toll of justification, some began to speak out against it. They argued that people should be allowed to live their lives without constantly having to defend their choices. That diversity and individuality should be celebrated, not stifled. 

Slowly but surely, this message began to resonate with people across the region. They began to see that the constant need to justify oneself was not only damaging to their emotional well-being, but also to the fabric of their society as a whole. 

In time, the practice of justification began to fade, replaced by a newfound respect for individuality and diversity. The emotional toll of years of constant justification could not be undone, but it was a small price to pay for a more accepting and inclusive society.
