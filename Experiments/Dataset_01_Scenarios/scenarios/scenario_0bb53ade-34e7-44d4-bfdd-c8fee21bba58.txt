The male population in Subsaharan Africa is facing a disruptive environmental issue that threatens their livelihoods and well-being. Illegal logging and deforestation are rampant in the region, leading to the destruction of natural habitats and the depletion of crucial resources. As a result, many men who rely on the forest for their livelihoods, such as hunters and gatherers, are struggling to make ends meet. Additionally, the loss of forest cover is contributing to climate change and exacerbating the already harsh living conditions in the region. Legal action is needed to address this issue and protect the rights of those affected by the environmental destruction. It is essential that policymakers come together to create sustainable solutions that balance the needs of the environment and the survival of the male population in Subsaharan Africa.
