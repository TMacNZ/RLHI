In a small village in rural Eurasia, a catastrophic disagreement had broken out between two groups of people. On one side, there were the locals who had been living in the village for generations. On the other side, there were the others who were newcomers to the village. The argument started over a piece of land that both groups claimed ownership of. It quickly escalated into a physical altercation with both groups attacking each other with whatever they could find. The fighting spread throughout the village, with buildings being burnt down and people being injured. It took the intervention of the local authorities to bring the situation under control. In the end, many lives had been lost, and the village was left in ruins. The incident left a lasting scar on the community, and it would take a long time for the wounds to heal.
