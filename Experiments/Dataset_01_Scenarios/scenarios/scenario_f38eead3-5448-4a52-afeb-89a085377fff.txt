It was the night of her high school graduation party and Mary was excited to celebrate with her friends. The music was blasting and the drinks were flowing as Mary danced the night away. However, things took a dangerous turn when Mary suddenly collapsed on the dance floor, clutching her chest in pain. Her friends frantically called for help as Mary struggled to breathe. It wasn't until later that they discovered the cause of her sudden collapse - Mary had a pre-existing heart condition that had been exacerbated by the excessive alcohol consumption and high-energy dancing. This health concern is not uncommon in Subsaharan Africa, where access to proper healthcare and education is limited. Mary's scary experience served as a reminder for her and her peers to prioritize their health and make informed decisions when it comes to partying.
