The theme of conflict and violence has become an annoyance in North America, as intellectual debates often turn into heated arguments and even physical altercations. With tensions running high on a global scale, discussions on controversial topics such as politics, race, and religion often escalate quickly, leaving little room for constructive dialogue. It's not uncommon for individuals to feel personally attacked or offended by opposing viewpoints, leading to a breakdown in communication. This trend is alarming, as it threatens the very foundations of civil discourse and mutual respect. If left unchecked, the escalating conflict and violence could have far-reaching consequences on the social fabric of North American society. It's imperative that steps are taken to promote more peaceful and respectful exchanges of ideas, even when discussing contentious issues.
