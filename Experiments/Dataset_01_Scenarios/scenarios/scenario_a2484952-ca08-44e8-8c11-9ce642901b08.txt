The year is 2205, and humanity has finally unlocked the secrets of intergalactic travel. The Galactic Federation, a governing body comprised of representatives from every inhabited planet, is responsible for ensuring the safety and prosperity of all its member worlds. However, a critical technological failure has occurred in South America, and the ramifications are dire. An assessment team dispatched to the region has determined that the failure was caused by a flaw in the legal framework governing the use of advanced technologies. Without swift action, the situation could spiral out of control, jeopardizing the entire region and potentially even the stability of the Federation itself. The fate of countless lives rests on the shoulders of the Federation's leaders, as they work to address the legal and technological issues at the heart of this crisis.
