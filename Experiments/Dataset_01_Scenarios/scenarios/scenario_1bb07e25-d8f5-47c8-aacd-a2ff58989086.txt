In a bustling North African city, an environmental issue has arisen due to technological advancements. The city has seen a rapid increase in population and with it, an increase in waste and pollution. While the government has implemented waste management systems, they have not been able to keep up with the amount of waste produced. As a result, large piles of trash remain on the streets for days, emitting a foul odor and attracting pests. The situation has worsened due to the rise of technology, with more electronic waste being produced and improperly disposed of. The city lacks proper recycling facilities, causing the electronic waste to pile up in landfills and further pollute the environment. The citizens are becoming increasingly concerned about the impact of this waste on their health and the environment, and are calling for immediate action to be taken. The government is now working on implementing better waste management systems and recycling facilities to address this environmental issue before it gets worse.
