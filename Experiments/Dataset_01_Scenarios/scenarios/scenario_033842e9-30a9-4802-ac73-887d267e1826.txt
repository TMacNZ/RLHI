Amidst the ongoing pandemic, the education sector has been hit hard by an unexpected technological failure. In an effort to make remote learning easy for students across Europe, a widely used online learning platform has experienced a major glitch, leaving both teachers and students in a state of frustration. The severity of the glitch is ordinary, but due to the international scope of the platform, it has affected a large number of students and teachers across multiple countries. As a result, students are struggling to access their online classes and teachers are unable to conduct their lessons effectively. The educational domain is in chaos as the glitch continues to persist, causing a major setback in the progress of students' education.
