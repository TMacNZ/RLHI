As a consultant for a large tech firm, Maria was tasked with developing a framework for assessing the economic impact of the company's projects in South America. However, as she delved deeper into her research, she uncovered a disruptive ethical dilemma.

Maria discovered that one of the company's major projects in the region was being built on land that had been illegally seized from indigenous communities. This project was expected to generate significant profits for the company, but it would also have a severe impact on the environment and the livelihoods of the local people.

Maria was faced with a difficult decision. On the one hand, she knew that her job was to develop a framework for assessing the economic impact of the project, and that her findings would be used to make important decisions about the future of the project. On the other hand, she was deeply concerned about the ethical implications of the project and the harm it could cause to the local communities.

After much deliberation, Maria decided to bring the issue to the attention of her superiors. She presented her findings and argued that the company had a responsibility to address the ethical issues surrounding the project before moving forward. Her superiors were initially resistant to her arguments, citing the potential profits that the project could generate. However, Maria persisted in her efforts to raise awareness about the issue and eventually managed to convince her superiors to take action.

The company ultimately decided to halt the project and conduct a full investigation into the land seizure and its impact on the local communities. Maria's framework was used to assess the economic impact of the decision to halt the project, and it was found that the company could still generate profits by investing in alternative projects that were more environmentally sustainable and socially responsible.

Maria's decision to highlight the ethical dilemma in the project had far-reaching consequences. It not only prevented the company from causing harm to the local communities but also helped to shift the company's focus towards more sustainable and responsible practices. Her courage and commitment to ethical principles earned her the respect and admiration of her colleagues and cemented her reputation as a trusted and respected consultant in the industry.
