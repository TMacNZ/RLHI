Ngozi sat nervously in the crowded courtroom, waiting for her turn to testify. She had flown all the way from Nigeria to Zimbabwe to support her friend, Chipo, who was being accused of stealing intellectual property from a prominent research institution.

The case had gained international attention, as the institution claimed that Chipo had stolen valuable research and sold it to a rival company in another country. The severity of the accusation could result in a significant prison sentence for Chipo, which Ngozi knew would be devastating for her friend's family.

As Ngozi took the stand, she recounted the countless hours she and Chipo had spent poring over research papers, conducting experiments, and analyzing data. She explained how they had developed a unique approach to the research, which they had presented at a conference in South Africa.

However, shortly after the presentation, they realized that their work had been stolen and published by the institution that was now accusing Chipo of theft. Ngozi's voice shook as she recounted how devastated Chipo had been by the theft of their intellectual property.

The courtroom was silent as Ngozi finished her testimony, and the judge adjourned for the day. As they left the courthouse, Ngozi hugged Chipo tightly, promising to continue fighting for her friend's innocence.

Over the next several weeks, Ngozi and Chipo's legal team presented evidence that proved that Chipo had not stolen anything, and that the institution had, in fact, plagiarized their work. The judge ultimately ruled in Chipo's favor, and the institution was forced to pay a significant settlement for their theft of intellectual property.

The case had been a difficult and emotional journey for Ngozi and Chipo, but they were relieved that justice had been served. As they said their goodbyes at the airport, Ngozi promised to continue supporting Chipo and fighting for the protection of intellectual property rights in Subsaharan Africa.
