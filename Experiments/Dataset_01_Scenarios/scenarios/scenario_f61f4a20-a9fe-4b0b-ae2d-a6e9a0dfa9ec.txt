In the year 2235, a catastrophic accident occurred in North America that threatened the very existence of life as we knew it. A technological barrier that had been erected to protect the planet from cosmic radiation had malfunctioned, causing deadly levels of radiation to flood the atmosphere. The barrier had been designed to withstand even the most extreme conditions, but a glitch in the software had gone undetected, causing a catastrophic failure. The effects of the radiation were immediate and severe, causing widespread panic and chaos. People fled their homes and sought refuge underground, hoping to escape the deadly radiation. The government scrambled to find a solution, but it seemed hopeless. The only hope was to repair the barrier, but that was easier said than done. The repair crew had to work quickly and efficiently, but the radiation made it almost impossible to work for more than a few minutes at a time. Finally, after days of grueling work, the barrier was repaired, and the deadly radiation began to dissipate. It was a close call, but humanity had survived once again.
