In a distant future, humanity has colonized the stars and formed alliances with alien civilizations. However, the useful alliance between the Earth Federation and the Krynn Empire is on the brink of collapse due to a catastrophic event in North Africa. A group of extremists from a cultural domain who resist the Federation's rule have launched a violent attack on a Krynn diplomatic mission, killing several high-ranking officials. The Krynn, outraged by the attack, have demanded swift justice and threatened to sever all ties with Earth if their demands are not met. Tensions are high as the Federation struggles to find a solution that will satisfy both parties while maintaining peace in the intergalactic community. However, with the threat of a larger conflict looming, the situation is rapidly spiraling out of control.
