The chosen family had always been conscious of their environmental impact, so when they decided to remodel their home in Europe, they made sure to hire a contractor who shared their values. However, as the renovation progressed, it became clear that the workers were not being treated fairly. They were working long hours with little breaks, and their safety equipment was inadequate. The chosen family was horrified and knew they needed to take action. They spoke to the contractor, who was dismissive and defensive. The family then reached out to labor organizations and discovered that the contractor had a history of mistreating workers. The family ultimately decided to terminate their contract with the contractor and find a new one who was committed to fair labor practices. While the delay and additional costs were frustrating, they knew it was the right thing to do. They also made a point to educate themselves on labor issues in the construction industry and vowed to only work with contractors who valued their workers' well-being going forward.
