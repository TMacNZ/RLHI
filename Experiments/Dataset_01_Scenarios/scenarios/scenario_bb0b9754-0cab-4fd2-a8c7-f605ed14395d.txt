In a world where technology has become an integral part of daily life, a critical health concern has emerged in Europe. The issue revolves around the freshness of food products that are being sold online. With the rise of e-commerce, more and more people are turning to the internet to buy groceries and other household essentials. However, many of the products being sold online are not as fresh as they claim to be. This has led to a significant increase in cases of food poisoning and other health problems across the continent. The situation has become so severe that authorities are now considering implementing strict regulations to ensure that all online sellers adhere to certain standards when it comes to the freshness of their products. The technological domain is being called upon to develop innovative solutions to address this issue and prevent further harm to the public.
