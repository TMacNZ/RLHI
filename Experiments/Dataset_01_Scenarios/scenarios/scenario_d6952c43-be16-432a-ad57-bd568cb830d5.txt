In the year 2148, the intergalactic community was facing a dangerous social challenge in the Middle East region. With the rise of adult unemployment rates, the economic stability of the region was at risk. The intergalactic government had tried to implement various policies to combat the issue, but to no avail. The situation had escalated to the point where the population was on the brink of a mass uprising. The lack of job opportunities had led to an increase in crime rates and social unrest. The intergalactic community knew that they had to act fast before the situation spiraled out of control. In a desperate attempt to alleviate the crisis, they sent in a team of experts to work with the local government and businesses to develop a comprehensive plan to create new job opportunities. The success of this mission would be critical not only for the Middle East but for the entire intergalactic community.
