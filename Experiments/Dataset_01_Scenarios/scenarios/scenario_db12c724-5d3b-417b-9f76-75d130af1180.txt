Clearly, political unrest in South Asia has had a detrimental impact on the environment. As individuals struggle to assert their political beliefs and gain control, the environment has been left to suffer the consequences. Pollution levels have skyrocketed due to a lack of government oversight and enforcement of environmental regulations. The destruction of natural habitats has also increased as individuals resort to extreme measures to assert their power. The typical severity of this situation is compounded by the fact that it is affecting the entire region, with no clear solution in sight. It is imperative that individuals and governments work together to address this issue before irreversible damage is done to the environment and the delicate ecosystems that rely on it.
