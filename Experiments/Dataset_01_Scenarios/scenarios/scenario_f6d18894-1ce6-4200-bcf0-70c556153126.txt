Hassan, a former engineer, was living in a small village in North Africa when he noticed his water filtration system was malfunctioning. He had designed the system himself to provide clean drinking water for his family and the surrounding community. As a result of the technical failure in the system, the water was contaminated with harmful pathogens, posing a life-threatening risk to those who drank it. Without access to clean water, people in the village began to fall ill, and children were particularly affected. Hassan knew he had to act quickly to prevent a potential outbreak of waterborne diseases. He contacted other engineers in the area to help him fix the system, but they were unable to solve the problem. With time running out, Hassan turned to his social network and reached out to an old colleague living in Europe. Together, they were able to identify the root cause of the failure and develop a plan to repair the system. Thanks to his quick thinking and network of contacts, Hassan was able to save lives and prevent a major health crisis in his community.
