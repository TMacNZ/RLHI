Maria lived in a small village in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. She had always been poor, but she was content with her simple life. One day, a company came to her village promising to bring electricity to the area. Excited at the prospect of having access to modern technology, Maria welcomed the company and its workers with open arms. However, the company's promises were empty, and they installed faulty electrical wires that caused a massive fire, destroying Maria's home and the homes of many others. The damage was irreparable, and the villagers were left with nothing. Maria tried to seek legal action against the company, but the legal system in South America was too complex and expensive for her to navigate. She was left feeling helpless and betrayed, with no hope of ever getting justice for what had been done to her and her community.
