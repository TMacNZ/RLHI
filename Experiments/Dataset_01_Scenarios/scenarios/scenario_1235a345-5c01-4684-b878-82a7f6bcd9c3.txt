In the vast expanse of the intergalactic region, there exists a political dilemma of an ethical nature. The formula for a new and revolutionary energy source has been discovered by a Pacific planet's government. However, the formula requires the exploitation of a rare mineral that can only be found on a nearby moon inhabited by a peaceful alien race. The annoyance arises from the fact that the Pacific planet's government is divided on whether to go through with the plan or not. Some believe that the benefits of the energy source outweigh any potential harm caused to the alien race, while others argue that their ethical code must come before their desire for progress. The fate of the Pacific planet's energy future hangs in the balance, as they grapple with this complex moral quandary.
