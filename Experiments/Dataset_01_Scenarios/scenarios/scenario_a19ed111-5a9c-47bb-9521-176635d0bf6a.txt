The South Pacific is facing a life-threatening environmental issue due to the credit system in place. The excessive use of credit cards and loans has led to an increase in plastic waste and pollution in the region. The plastic waste is not only harming the marine life but also affecting the health of the local population. The situation has become so severe that it has become a global concern. The educational institutions in the region have launched campaigns to raise awareness about the impact of credit on the environment. They are educating the students and the local community about sustainable practices and the importance of reducing plastic waste. The hope is to inspire a change in behavior and eventually reduce the use of credit in the region. It is a daunting task, but the future of the South Pacific depends on it.
