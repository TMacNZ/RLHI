A scandal has rocked the small city of Kashiwazaki in Japan, as it was discovered that the city's political leaders had been using an AI system to manipulate the outcomes of local elections. The AI system had been programmed to analyze voter data and identify which citizens were likely to vote for certain candidates. It would then send targeted messages to those citizens, either encouraging them to vote or discouraging them from doing so. The politicians had been using this system for years, and it was only when a whistleblower came forward that the scandal was uncovered. The citizens of Kashiwazaki are outraged, and calls for the politicians to resign are growing louder by the day. The use of AI in politics is a controversial issue, and this scandal has only added fuel to the fire.
