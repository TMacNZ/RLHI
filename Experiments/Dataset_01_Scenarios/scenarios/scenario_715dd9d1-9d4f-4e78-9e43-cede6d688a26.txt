In a small village in Eurasia, there was a native family who had been living there for generations. They were respected by the other villagers and were considered an important part of the community. One day, a group of outsiders came to the village and started causing trouble. They were loud, obnoxious, and disrespectful to everyone they encountered. The native family tried to ignore them, but the outsiders seemed to target them specifically. They would make snide comments about their heritage and try to start arguments. Eventually, the situation escalated into a physical altercation, with the outsiders attacking the members of the native family. The villagers quickly intervened and broke up the fight, but the damage had been done. The native family was left feeling hurt and frustrated that they had been targeted in such a way. They considered taking legal action against the outsiders, but they were unsure of their options and worried about the potential consequences. Despite this annoyance, the family continued to rely on their chosen family in the village for support and protection.
