The extended family gathered in the courtyard of their home in Subsaharan Africa, their faces somber and their hearts heavy. The news had just arrived that a devastating natural disaster had struck their neighboring village, leaving many dead and injured. As they waited for more information, their thoughts turned to their spiritual beliefs and the power of prayer. The elder matriarch of the family, known for her strong faith, led the group in a prayer for the victims and their families. As they finished, they shared a moment of silence, holding each other close. It was then that the youngest member of the family, a small child, ran up to her parents and planted a kiss on their cheeks, bringing a small glimmer of hope and joy to the otherwise solemn atmosphere.
