Under the new regime, the online community in the Pacific region has been deeply impacted by a critical environmental issue. With the rising sea levels, many coastal communities are facing displacement and the loss of their homes and livelihoods. Social media has become a crucial platform for those affected to voice their concerns and share their stories. However, the regime has been censoring and suppressing these voices, preventing the public from understanding the severity of the situation. The online community is now struggling to find new ways to spread awareness and advocate for environmental action, despite facing severe consequences from the authorities. The regime's actions have sparked outrage and fear, leaving many feeling hopeless and helpless in the face of this growing crisis.
