In the year 2050, humanity had finally established contact with extraterrestrial life. The aliens spoke a language that was completely foreign to us, and it took years for linguists to develop a way to communicate with them. However, the breakthrough led to a new era of intergalactic trade, with South American countries playing a significant role in the export of various goods to alien worlds. Unfortunately, a financial crisis hit the region, and educational institutions were hit especially hard. The disruption caused the abandonment of language programs that were essential for communication with extraterrestrial beings. As a result, the South American countries started to lose out on intergalactic trade, and their economies suffered greatly. The situation was dire, and urgent measures were needed to salvage the situation. The governments of these countries had to act fast to ensure that they did not lose their place in the intergalactic community.
