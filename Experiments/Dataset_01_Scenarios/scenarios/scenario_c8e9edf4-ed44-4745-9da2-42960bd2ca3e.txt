In the Middle East, on board an interstellar spacecraft, a critical incident occurred in the scientific domain. The crew had been conducting experiments on the effects of baking in zero gravity, hoping to develop new ways to produce food for long space missions. However, during one of their experiments, something went wrong with the oven, causing a small fire to break out. The crew quickly donned their emergency gear and worked together to extinguish the flames before they could spread to the rest of the ship. Though they were able to prevent a disaster, the incident highlighted the dangers of conducting experiments in space and the importance of constant vigilance when working with critical equipment.
