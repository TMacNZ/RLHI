When their parents passed away, the three siblings were left to fend for themselves. They had no other relatives to turn to, so they formed their own chosen family. They had always been close, but now they relied on each other completely. They lived in a somewhat isolated area on the Pacific coast, where they had to be self-sufficient. But their biggest challenge was the lack of access to education. The nearest school was miles away, and they couldn't afford to travel there regularly. They tried to teach themselves as much as they could, but it wasn't enough. The youngest sibling, who was only nine years old, was struggling the most. They knew that education was crucial for their future, but they didn't know what to do. One day, they heard about a program that provided free online education. It seemed like the perfect solution, but there was a catch. The program required a stable internet connection, which was something they didn't have. They had to find a way to get online, but it was dangerous to leave their home unattended. They had to come up with a plan fast, or risk losing their chances for a better future.
