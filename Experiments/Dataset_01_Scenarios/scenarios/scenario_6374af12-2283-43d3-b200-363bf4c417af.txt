In a small community in North America, a technological issue has caused a catastrophic social challenge. The internet service provider that serves the area has suddenly shut down, leaving the entire community without access to the internet. This has caused communication breakdowns, as people are unable to connect with loved ones outside of the community, access important information, or work remotely. Without the internet, people are struggling to keep their businesses afloat, and many are without jobs. The lack of access to online education is causing students to fall behind in their studies. The community is in a state of chaos as people try to find alternative ways to communicate and work. The community leaders are scrambling to find a solution, but for now, the community is cut off from the rest of the world, and the consequences are severe.
