The late payment was the final straw in the ongoing disagreement between the two business partners. Ebube had been working tirelessly to keep the small printing business afloat, while his partner, Adewale, had been slacking off and neglecting his responsibilities. Ebube had repeatedly confronted Adewale about his negligence, but he always brushed it off and promised to improve. However, when the rent for the printing shop was due and Adewale failed to submit his share of the payment on time, Ebube knew that things had reached a breaking point. He had to dip into his personal savings to cover the rent and keep the business from being evicted. It was an irreversible decision that left Ebube feeling resentful and betrayed by his partner. As a result of their economic disagreement, Ebube decided to dissolve their partnership and take full control of the business. It was a tough decision to make, but he knew that it was necessary to ensure the survival of the printing business in Subsaharan Africa.
