Basically, Sarah and her colleague Tom work together in a scientific research lab in Europe. They have been paired up to work on a project for the past few weeks, and Sarah has noticed that Tom has a tendency to talk a lot during their work hours. Sarah appreciates a good conversation, but she finds it hard to concentrate on her work when Tom is constantly chatting away. She has tried to politely steer the conversation back to their work, but Tom seems oblivious to her hints. Sarah doesn't want to be rude, but the annoyance is starting to affect her productivity. She decides to talk to their supervisor about the issue, hoping that they can find a solution that won't damage their working relationship.
