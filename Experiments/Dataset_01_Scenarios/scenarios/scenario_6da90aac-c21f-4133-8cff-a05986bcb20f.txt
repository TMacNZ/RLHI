In a small South Asian community, the primary source of water has become contaminated, causing widespread illness and even death. The local government has been slow to respond, leaving the community to fend for themselves. As tensions rise, an ethical dilemma arises: should the community take matters into their own hands and steal clean water from nearby towns, or should they continue to suffer and hope for official assistance? Emotions run high as families struggle to care for their sick loved ones and worry about the future of their community. The decision to act illegally could have far-reaching consequences, but the thought of more people falling ill or dying is too much to bear. The community must come together to make a difficult choice that will shape their future and test their sense of right and wrong.
