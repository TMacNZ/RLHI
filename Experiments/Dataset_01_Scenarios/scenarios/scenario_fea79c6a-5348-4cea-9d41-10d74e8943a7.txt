The chosen family had planned a much-awaited reunion in the Middle East after years of living in different parts of the world. They were all excited to share stories, enjoy home-cooked meals, and take part in adventurous activities. However, their plans were hindered by a technological failure that caused an annoyance to everyone. The Wi-Fi connection in the villa they rented was weak, and everyone struggled to maintain their concentration on the video calls they were trying to make with their loved ones who couldn't attend the reunion. They had hoped to share the joy of being reunited with those who couldn't be there, but the slow internet connection made it impossible. Despite their frustration, they managed to find a solution by relying on their own company and making the most of the quality time they had together without the distraction of technology.
