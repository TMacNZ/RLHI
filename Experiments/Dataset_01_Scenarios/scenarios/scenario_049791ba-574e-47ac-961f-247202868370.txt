In a bustling North American city, residents begin to notice an increase in the number of sick birds. The local scientific community is concerned that the health of the city's bird population is at risk. Reports suggest that the birds are displaying symptoms such as lethargy, disorientation, and difficulty breathing. The cause of the illness is not immediately clear, but scientists suspect that pollution and environmental toxins may be playing a role. With the bird population being an integral part of the local ecosystem, the scientific community is working to identify the root cause of this health concern and develop solutions to protect the birds and their habitat.
