In rural Subsaharan Africa, a nuclear family was burdened with a technological failure that left them without power for weeks. With no access to electricity, the family struggled to complete everyday tasks like cooking, cleaning, and studying. The father had to resort to using a kerosene lamp to finish his work for the day, while the mother had to cook on an open fire, causing respiratory issues for the family. The children were unable to study after dark, falling behind in their education. Despite their efforts to fix the issue, the family was unable to afford the necessary repairs, leaving them in the dark for an indefinite period of time. The lack of technology not only hindered their daily lives but also had long-term consequences for their future opportunities.
