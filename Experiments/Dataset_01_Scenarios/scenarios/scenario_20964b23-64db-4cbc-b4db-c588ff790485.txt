The launch of the new academic year in Europe was marred by the aftermath of a natural disaster that would have long-lasting effects on both students and faculty members alike. The region had been hit by a strong earthquake, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. Schools and universities were not spared, and many educational institutions had to delay or cancel their opening day due to the damages sustained. Students who were eagerly anticipating their first day back to school were left anxious and uncertain about their education. Faculty members, on the other hand, were left scrambling to find alternative teaching locations and methods. The disaster had a profound impact on the educational domain in the region, and it would take years to fully recover from the devastation.
