Sara, a young woman from the Middle East, has recently started a job at a large institutional bank in her city. As part of her training, she was introduced to an AI system that manages client data and transactions. However, she quickly noticed that the AI system was not taking into account the cultural norms and practices of the clients in the region. For example, it would suggest investment opportunities that were not in line with clients' religious beliefs or recommend communication methods that were considered inappropriate in the local culture. Although the impact of these oversights was insignificant, Sara understood that it could potentially harm the bank's reputation and create discomfort for the clients. She raised her concerns to her supervisor and suggested implementing cultural sensitivity training for the AI system. The supervisor appreciated Sara's feedback and took action to improve the system's algorithms to account for cultural differences.
