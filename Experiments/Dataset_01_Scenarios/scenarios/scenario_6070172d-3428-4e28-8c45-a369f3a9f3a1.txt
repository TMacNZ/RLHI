In the year 2305, the Intergalactic Council faced a catastrophic situation in North Africa. The council had been recruiting new members from various planets to join their mission of exploring the universe and ensuring intergalactic peace. However, due to a mundane technological issue, all the data of the new recruits got corrupted, and the council was left with no way to identify who had joined and who had not. With the deadline to finalize the new recruits fast approaching, the council had to act quickly. They dispatched a team of engineers to North Africa, where the data center was located, to fix the issue. The team had to work around the clock to recover the lost data, and they finally managed to do so just in time. The council was able to identify the new recruits, and the mission to explore the universe continued with new members from various planets.
