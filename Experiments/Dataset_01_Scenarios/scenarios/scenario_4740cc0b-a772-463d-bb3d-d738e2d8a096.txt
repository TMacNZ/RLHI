In Europe, a serious interpersonal problem has arisen due to the origin of AI control problem. Cultural differences have led to conflicting views on the control and use of AI technology. This has caused tension between individuals and communities who have differing beliefs on the appropriate use of AI. Some believe that AI should be controlled by individuals, while others believe that it should be controlled by a centralized authority. These differences have led to heated debates and even conflicts, as each side believes that their perspective is the only correct one. The challenge now is to find a way to bridge this cultural divide and create a shared understanding of the role AI should play in society.
