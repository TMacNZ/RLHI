Maria was settling in for a cozy night at home in her apartment in Sao Paulo, Brazil. She turned on her TV to catch up on her favorite telenovela, only to find that the screen remained blank. Frustrated, she tried changing the channel, but still no luck. After a few more attempts, she realized that her TV had completely malfunctioned. Without her trusty companion, Maria felt lost and disconnected from the world outside her apartment. She relied on her TV to keep her company during long nights alone, and now she was left feeling uneasy and bored. She tried to distract herself with a book or some music, but it just wasn't the same. Maria realized how much she had come to depend on her TV and couldn't wait to get it fixed or replaced.
