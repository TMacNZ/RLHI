As she gazed up at the vast expanse of space above her, Mariam felt a sense of awe and terror. She was on a camping trip in the deserts of North Africa and had decided to spend the night stargazing. But as the night wore on, she couldn't shake off the feeling that she was insignificant in the grand cosmic scheme of things. The realization that her life was just a tiny blip in the vastness of the universe was overwhelming, and she felt a deep sense of despair. The thought of her own mortality and the fleeting nature of life left her feeling helpless and powerless. Mariam knew she had to snap out of it and focus on the present moment, but the fear and anxiety lingered on, casting a shadow over her otherwise peaceful camping trip.
