Zahra is a successful painter living in the Middle East. She has built a chosen family of fellow artists who support her work and help her navigate the art world. One day, Zahra's computer, which she uses to store and edit her artwork, suddenly shuts down and won't turn back on. She panics, realizing that she has not backed up her recent paintings and all her hard work may be lost. Zahra turns to her chosen family for help, hoping that someone can recover her files. Unfortunately, none of her artist friends are skilled in computer repair, so they suggest she take it to a local repair shop. Zahra takes her computer to the shop, where they diagnose a hardware failure and tell her that her files may not be recoverable. Zahra is devastated and heartbroken, feeling like she has lost a part of herself. She turns to her chosen family for emotional support and they remind her that her talent as a painter is not defined by a technological failure. Together, they encourage her to start fresh and create new artwork, which she does with renewed passion and vigor.
