In a small town in Europe, a critical ethical dilemma has arisen. It involves a close-knit group of friends who have known each other since childhood. One of the friends, let's call her Sarah, has always struggled with her emotions and self-worth. Recently, she confided in her friends that she had been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. The group rallied around her, offering support and encouragement. However, one of the friends, let's call her Emily, has started to become increasingly concerned. Emily has noticed that Sarah seems to be using her struggles as a way to gain attention and sympathy from the group. Emily is torn between wanting to support her friend and not wanting to enable Sarah's behavior. The situation has become even more complicated as Sarah's behavior has started to create tension within the group itself. Emily knows that she needs to address the issue, but she is unsure of how to do so without causing further harm.
