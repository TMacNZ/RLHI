In the year 2050, humanity developed a way to harness the power of the cosmos to create unlimited energy. However, this came at a great cost. The process required the sacrifice of a celestial body, causing irreparable damage to the cosmic balance. As a result, the entirety of North America was plunged into eternal darkness, with no hope of ever seeing the sun again. The ethical dilemma arose when it was discovered that the emotional toll on the population was devastating. Suicide rates skyrocketed as people struggled to cope with the loss of the sun and the knowledge that their actions had caused this irreversible damage. The debate raged on about whether the unlimited energy was worth the cost, and whether the decision-makers could live with the emotional burden of their actions. The once-thriving cities of North America became ghost towns, with only a few remaining who chose to live in the darkness. The weight of the decision made by humanity would be felt for generations to come, as the consequences of their actions echoed throughout the cosmos.
