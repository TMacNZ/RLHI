In the Middle East, a group of interstellar travelers made an unexpected landing on a sacred site. They were on a mission to count the number of habitable planets in the galaxy, but their spacecraft malfunctioned and crash-landed on the holy ground. The local religious leaders were outraged, as the area was considered to be off-limits to outsiders. The incident disrupted the spiritual balance of the region, and tensions rose between the visitors and the locals. The interstellar travelers tried to explain their mission, but the language barrier made communication difficult. The situation became more complicated when one of the visitors found an ancient artifact on the site. The artifact was considered to be a religious relic by the locals, and they demanded its return. The count of habitable planets was forgotten, and the focus shifted to resolving the situation peacefully. After several days of negotiations, the travelers were allowed to leave with the artifact, but they promised to never return to the sacred site again.
