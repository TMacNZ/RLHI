In North Africa, tensions were high between two scientific research institutions. The first institution had recently made a breakthrough discovery in a new field that the second institution had been working on for years. The second institution accused the first of stealing their research and demanded a transfer of all data and findings. The dispute quickly escalated with both sides accusing the other of unethical behavior. The situation quickly devolved into a violent conflict with protests and vandalism. The long-lasting effects of this conflict were felt throughout the scientific community, causing a rift between the institutions and a lack of trust in the research process. The transfer of data never occurred, and the discovery was eventually published by the first institution, leading to further tension and hostility.
