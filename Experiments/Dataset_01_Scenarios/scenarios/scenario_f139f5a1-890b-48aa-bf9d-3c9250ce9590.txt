Thus began the irreversible downfall of the once-thriving city in Eurasia. The source of the catastrophic event was the failure of the educational system's technological infrastructure, which caused widespread chaos and confusion. The village schools were unable to provide basic education to their students, and the city's universities were forced to shut down indefinitely. As a result, the youth were left without proper guidance and direction, and the city's economic future became uncertain. The once-bustling streets were now empty, with empty classrooms and abandoned buildings serving as a reminder of the city's downfall. The citizens have no choice but to leave their beloved city in search of better opportunities elsewhere, leaving behind a ghost town in the heart of Eurasia.
