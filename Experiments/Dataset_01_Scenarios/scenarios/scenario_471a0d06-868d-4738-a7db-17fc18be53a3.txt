The air was filled with the deafening sound of crumbling structures and screaming voices. The disaster had caused massive destruction, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake. The magnitude of the event was still being assessed, but it was clear that the recent cosmic explosion had taken a heavy toll on the physical world.
