In the early morning hours on a distant planet in South Asia, two intergalactic philosophers engaged in a heated argument. One believed that subjective experience was the only true reality, while the other argued that objective reality existed outside of individual perception. As they debated, the severity of their disagreement grew, and soon they were hurling insults at each other. Suddenly, a dangerous anomaly occurred in the atmosphere, causing the ground to shake and the sky to turn a deep shade of purple. The philosophers realized that their argument had awakened an ancient force, and that they must work together to solve the problem before it was too late. They put aside their differences and used their knowledge of philosophy to devise a plan. By combining their perspectives of subjective and objective reality, they were able to identify the source of the anomaly and neutralize it. As the sky returned to its natural blue hue, the philosophers reflected on the lesson they had learned: that even in the midst of disagreement, collaboration and mutual respect can lead to a successful outcome.
