Bethany, a member of an extended family living in North America, had always been a bit of a free spirit. She never liked sticking to a routine and often found herself wandering around the city, exploring new places and meeting new people. One day, while out on one of her adventures, she met a stranger who seemed friendly enough. They struck up a conversation and talked for a while before parting ways. 

A few weeks later, Bethany received a call from her bank, informing her that her savings account had been emptied. She was devastated and confused, unable to figure out how it could have happened. She went to the bank and explained the situation, but they told her that the transaction had been authorized with her PIN. 

After some investigation, it was discovered that the stranger she had met had somehow managed to get her PIN during their conversation and had then stolen all of her savings. Bethany was devastated and felt violated, knowing that she would never be able to recover the money. This mundane issue had turned into an irreversible economic problem that had a lasting impact on her life.
