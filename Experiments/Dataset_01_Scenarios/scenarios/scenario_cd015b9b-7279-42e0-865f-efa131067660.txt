Scientists across North America have been alarmed by the discovery of a troubling new environmental issue - a list of technological debris floating around in outer space. This cosmic garbage, which includes everything from discarded satellites to broken rocket parts, poses a serious threat to our planet and the delicate balance of our universe. The debris can collide with functioning spacecraft, potentially causing catastrophic damage and endangering the lives of astronauts. The situation has become so severe that many scientists are calling for urgent action to be taken to clean up the mess before it's too late. Failure to address this issue could have far-reaching consequences for the future of space exploration and our place in the cosmos.
