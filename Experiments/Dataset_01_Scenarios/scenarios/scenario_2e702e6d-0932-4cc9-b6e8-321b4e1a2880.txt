One day, in a bustling city of Asia, a group of friends got into a heated argument about the use of a passcode to access their mobile phones. One of the friends insisted that it was crucial to have a passcode to protect important personal information on the phone. However, another friend disagreed and argued that it was unnecessary and a waste of time to enter a passcode every time they wanted to use their phone. The disagreement escalated quickly, and before long, the group was divided into two factions. Suddenly, one of the friends collapsed on the ground, gasping for breath. It turned out that the friend who opposed the use of a passcode had a severe allergic reaction and needed immediate medical attention. Unfortunately, the passcode on their phone prevented anyone from accessing their emergency contacts or medical information. Frantic and panicking, the group realized that their argument over the passcode had cost their friend's life. They learned a hard lesson that day about the importance of personal safety and the consequences of allowing technological disagreements to spiral out of control.
