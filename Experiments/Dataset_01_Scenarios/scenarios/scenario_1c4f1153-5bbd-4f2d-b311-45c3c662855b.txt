In the Pacific region, a major ethical dilemma has arisen in the economic domain that could have life-threatening consequences. A pharmaceutical company has developed a life-saving drug that has been proven effective in treating a rare and deadly disease. However, the cost of the drug is exorbitant, making it unaffordable for many patients who desperately need it. The company argues that the high cost is necessary to recoup the significant investment they made in research and development. However, many individuals and organizations are calling for the government to intervene and impose price controls to make the drug more accessible to those in need. The issue has sparked a heated debate, with some arguing that the government should not interfere in the free market and that the company has the right to set its own prices. Others contend that access to life-saving medication should not be determined by one's ability to pay, and that the government has a responsibility to ensure that all citizens have access to healthcare. As the debate rages on, patients with the rare disease are left in a precarious situation, unsure if they will be able to afford the life-saving drug that they need to survive.
