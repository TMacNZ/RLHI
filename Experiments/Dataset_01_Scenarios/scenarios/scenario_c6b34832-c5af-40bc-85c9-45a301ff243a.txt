The political unrest in the Middle East has taken a severe toll on the educational system of the region. The government's narrative of the situation has caused irreversible damage to the education sector. The federal authorities have imposed strict regulations on academic institutions, resulting in a significant decline in the quality of education. The national curriculum has been altered to fit the political agenda of the ruling regime, leaving no room for critical thinking or open discussion. Teachers and professors who dare to challenge the government's narrative are being targeted and silenced. Students are also suffering as their access to quality education is limited. The future of the Middle East's intellectual capabilities is in jeopardy due to the government's actions. It is a dire situation that must be addressed before it's too late.
