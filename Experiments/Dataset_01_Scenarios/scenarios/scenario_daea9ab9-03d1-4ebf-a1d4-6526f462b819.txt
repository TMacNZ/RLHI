In a distant future, interstellar travel has become a reality. People from different planets and galaxies have established contact with each other to exchange knowledge and ideas. However, as they venture deeper into the vastness of space, they encounter a long-lasting environmental issue that threatens their survival. The die-off of a particular species of space algae has caused a catastrophic ripple effect, leading to the disappearance of several other important species in the interstellar ecosystem. This event has had a significant impact on the South American region where the algae was first discovered. As a result, the educational institutions of the region have come together to develop a comprehensive curriculum to study the issue and find ways to mitigate its effects. Students are taught about the importance of maintaining ecological balance and the repercussions of ignoring environmental issues in interstellar travel. The hope is that they will become the next generation of scientists and thinkers who can work together to solve this problem and prevent similar issues from arising in the future.
