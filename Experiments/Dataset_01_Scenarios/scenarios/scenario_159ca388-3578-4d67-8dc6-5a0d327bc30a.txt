In Eurasia, a simple yet persistent social challenge exists in the professional arena, particularly in the intellectual domain. Many professionals struggle to balance their workload and personal life, leading to burnout and decreased productivity. Despite the ordinary severity of the issue, the lack of work-life balance can have a significant impact on individuals' mental health and the overall success of their careers. To address this challenge, employers are encouraged to implement policies and programs that prioritize employee well-being, such as flexible work arrangements and mental health support. Additionally, professionals must be proactive in setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care to maintain a healthy work-life balance.
