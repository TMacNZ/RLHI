In a laboratory in Europe, a team of scientists were conducting experiments on the human brain with the aim of unlocking its mysteries. They had been working tirelessly for several months and were on the verge of a breakthrough when an accident occurred. One of the scientists accidentally spilled a highly toxic chemical on the brain they were working on. The chemical reacted with the brain tissue and caused an unexpected chain reaction that resulted in a massive release of energy. The energy was so intense that it created a tiny black hole that began to suck in everything in the laboratory. The scientists were caught off guard and tried to escape but it was too late. The whole laboratory was pulled into the black hole and disappeared without a trace. It was later discovered that the black hole had expanded and consumed not only the laboratory but the entire city and eventually the entire continent. The incident sent shockwaves throughout the scientific community and led to a complete ban on the use of highly volatile chemicals in brain research.
