In South Asia, the challenge of philosophical reflection has taken on a life-threatening severity. As the region grapples with issues of poverty, inequality, and political instability, many are turning to philosophical teachings for guidance and solace. However, the lack of access to education and resources means that only a small portion of the population is able to engage in this kind of reflection. This has led to a growing divide between those who are able to access philosophical teachings and those who are not, exacerbating existing social and economic inequalities. As a result, the need for greater investment in education and resources for philosophical reflection has become increasingly urgent, as it has the potential to bridge these divides and create a more equitable society for all.
