Ana had grown up with her best friend, Maria, who lived right next door. They did everything together, from playing dress-up to sharing secrets. However, when Ana's father lost his job, the family was forced to move to a new city in South America to find work. The move was difficult for Ana, especially since she had to leave her best friend behind. 

Years passed, and Ana had lost touch with Maria. However, one day, Ana received a frantic call from Maria's mother, who still lived in their old neighborhood. Maria's family had been caught in the middle of a violent conflict, and their home was destroyed in a catastrophic explosion. Maria's parents were killed instantly, and Maria was badly injured. 

Without hesitation, Ana packed her bags and made the long journey back to her old neighborhood. When she arrived, she found Maria in a hospital, barely conscious and fighting for her life. Ana stayed by Maria's side, holding her hand and offering words of encouragement. Despite the chaos and violence that surrounded them, Ana was determined to be there for her friend in her time of need.
