In a small town in the Pacific region, the deputy of the local police force was faced with a life-threatening situation. A technological failure in the social domain had caused a major blackout, leaving the town in complete darkness. As the deputy rushed to respond to emergency calls, they quickly realized that the lack of power was not the only issue they were facing. Without functioning communication systems or streetlights, the deputy was forced to navigate the town blindly, putting their life on the line with every step they took. It was a terrifying situation, with the possibility of danger lurking around every corner. The deputy knew that they had to act quickly to restore order and safety to the town, but in that moment, they couldn't help but wonder if they would make it out alive.
