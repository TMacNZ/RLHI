Fatima, a young woman living in North Africa, is facing an ethical dilemma involving her grandmother. Her grandmother is very sick and requires expensive medical treatment that Fatima cannot afford. The only way to pay for the treatment is to sell her grandmother's land, which has been in the family for generations. Fatima knows that her grandmother would never agree to sell the land, but she also knows that if she doesn't sell it, her grandmother will not receive the care she needs. Fatima is torn between her love for her grandmother and her duty to provide her with the necessary medical treatment. She is also worried about the legal consequences of selling the land without her grandmother's consent. Fatima must make a difficult decision that will impact her family's future and her own moral compass.
