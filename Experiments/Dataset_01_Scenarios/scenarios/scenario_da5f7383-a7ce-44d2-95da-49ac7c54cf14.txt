In the year 2077, the third interstellar mission to explore a habitable planet was launched. The team of astronauts had been preparing for years for this momentous journey. However, what they didn't anticipate was that the long-lasting effects of interstellar travel would have a profound impact on their emotional well-being. As they travelled through space for months on end, the astronauts began to experience intense feelings of isolation and loneliness. The vast emptiness of space weighed heavily on their souls, and they longed for the comfort of home. Meanwhile, on Earth, a health concern was brewing in Subsaharan Africa. A new virus had emerged, causing widespread panic and fear. The emotional toll of the pandemic was taking its toll on people's mental health, exacerbating existing conditions like anxiety and depression. As the interstellar mission continued, the astronauts struggled to cope with their own emotional challenges while watching from afar as their loved ones back on Earth dealt with their own struggles. The long-lasting effects of their journey would continue to be felt for years to come, both on the astronauts and the people back on Earth.
