In rural areas of Asia, the lack of access to healthcare is a critical concern for many people, particularly those who cannot afford to travel to the nearest hospital. In these regions, people often rely on community health workers to provide basic medical care and education. However, a life-threatening health concern arises when the community health worker falls ill, such as in the case of Me, a dedicated health worker who has been providing medical services to her village for years. Me contracted a deadly virus while caring for a patient and now she is unable to receive the medical attention she needs due to the lack of facilities and resources in her remote location. Her colleagues have been working tirelessly to find a way to transport her to a hospital, but the nearest one is several hours away by car and the roads are in poor condition. The situation has left the entire community in a state of panic and uncertainty, as they worry about Me's health and the future of their medical services.
