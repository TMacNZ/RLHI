In Subsaharan Africa, there is a growing concern about the lack of efficiency in enforcing environmental laws at the national or federal level. Despite having strong policies in place to protect the environment, there is a lack of effective implementation and enforcement of these laws, leading to widespread environmental degradation. Illegal logging, poaching, and pollution from industries are just a few examples of the environmental issues that are plaguing the region. The lack of efficiency in enforcing these laws is not only harming the environment but also posing a threat to the health and livelihoods of local communities. As a result, there is a need for more stringent measures to be put in place to ensure that the laws are being followed and enforced effectively. This will require the involvement of legal experts, policymakers, and enforcement agencies to work together towards creating a more sustainable future for Subsaharan Africa.
