As a short, wiry man with a thick accent, Mr. Kabila had always been underestimated. But as a respected teacher in a small village in Subsaharan Africa, he had earned the trust and admiration of his community. However, his recent decision had caused quite a stir amongst the parents of his students. Mr. Kabila had refused to give preferential treatment to his own daughter, a bright student who had always excelled in his classes. Despite her pleas and tears, he had given her the same grades as her classmates, earning her the reputation of a mediocre student. The parents were divided on the matter, with some praising Mr. Kabila's integrity and others accusing him of being too harsh on his own child. For Mr. Kabila, it was a difficult ethical dilemma. He knew that giving his daughter special treatment would be unfair to the other students, but he couldn't bear to see her suffer the consequences of his decision. It was a disruptive situation, with tensions running high amongst the parents and students alike. Mr. Kabila knew that his decision would have far-reaching implications, not just for his daughter but for the entire community.
