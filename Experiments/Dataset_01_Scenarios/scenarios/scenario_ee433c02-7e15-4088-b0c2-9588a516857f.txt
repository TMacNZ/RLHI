In a small town in Eurasia, two neighbors were involved in a huge argument. The argument started when one of the neighbors started constructing a fence that extended beyond their property line, and the other neighbor noticed. The second neighbor approached the first neighbor and pointed out that they were encroaching on their property, but the first neighbor refused to listen. The argument escalated quickly, with both neighbors shouting and accusing each other of being in the wrong. Finally, the second neighbor threatened to take legal action if the first neighbor didn't remove the fence. Eventually, the first neighbor agreed to move the fence back to their property line, and the argument was resolved.
