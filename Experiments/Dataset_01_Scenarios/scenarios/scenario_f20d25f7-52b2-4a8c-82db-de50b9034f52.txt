In a small town in Eurasia, two educators, both with years of experience, are having a dangerous disagreement that is affecting the educational system. The real issue at hand is their vastly different teaching styles. One believes in a hands-on approach, while the other is more traditional and believes in lectures and textbooks. The severity of their argument is causing a rift in the educational community, with some teachers taking sides and students feeling the tension in the classroom. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the two educators are also neighbors and have been friends for years. The town is on edge, unsure of how this conflict will be resolved and what the future holds for the education system.
