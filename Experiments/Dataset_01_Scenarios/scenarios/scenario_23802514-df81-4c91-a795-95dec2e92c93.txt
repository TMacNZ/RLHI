As an economist living in North Africa, I had always been aware of the potential for conflict and violence in the region. However, I never imagined that technology would become a key player in exacerbating the situation. It started with the widespread use of social media to spread false information and incite hatred between different ethnic and religious groups. This led to an increase in tensions and sporadic outbreaks of violence. But things took a turn for the worse when a group of hackers launched a cyber-attack on the country's banking system, causing widespread chaos and panic. Suddenly, people were unable to access their money, and the economy ground to a halt. The government struggled to regain control, but the damage had been done. As an economist, I knew that it would take years for the country to recover from this technological assault on its financial system. It was a stark reminder that in today's world, even seemingly ordinary conflicts can have devastating consequences when technology is used as a weapon.
