In the year 2305, an intergalactic rose species was discovered on a planet in a far-off galaxy. It was a beautiful and rare flower with a fragrance that could intoxicate any living being. However, this rose species turned out to be extremely dangerous. When humans were exposed to its scent for a prolonged period, it caused them to lose control of their emotions and become violent. The rose was brought back to Earth for research purposes, but it soon became a social challenge for Europe. People were illegally smuggling the flower for personal use, causing a rise in violent crimes. The legal system struggled to keep up with the new wave of crime, and the rose became a hot topic for debate. Some argued that the flower should be banned altogether, while others believed that it was a matter of personal freedom. The government had to come up with a solution before the situation spiraled out of control.
