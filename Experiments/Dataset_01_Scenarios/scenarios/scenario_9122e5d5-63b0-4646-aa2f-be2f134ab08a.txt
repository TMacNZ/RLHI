In the Middle Eastern nation of Zahir, political unrest had been brewing for years. The ruling regime had become increasingly authoritarian, and citizens were growing restless. However, it wasn't until the government made a decision that would have irreversible consequences that the tensions boiled over. The government announced that they would be shutting down all universities in the country, citing budget concerns. This decision was met with outrage from the student population, who saw it as an attack on their education and their future. Protests erupted across the country, with students taking to the streets, waving signs and chanting slogans. The protests quickly turned violent, with police responding with tear gas and batons. The golden age of education in Zahir, once a point of pride, had come to a crushing end.
