In South Asia, a long-lasting financial crisis has strongly impacted the environmental domain. The lack of proper financial planning and management in the region has led to a severe deterioration of the environment. With no funds allocated for environmental protection, industries and factories have been neglecting their responsibility towards the environment. The air and water quality have significantly deteriorated, leading to an increase in respiratory diseases and water-borne illnesses among the population. The region's forests and wildlife have also been greatly affected, with deforestation and habitat destruction being rampant due to the lack of enforcement of environmental regulations. The situation is only getting worse with time, and it is imperative for the government and industries to take immediate action towards mitigating the environmental crisis.
