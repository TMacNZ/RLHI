Growing up in a subsaharan African country, I always felt a certain level of disconnection with my extended family. My parents were both born and raised in Japan, and as a result, our family traditions, language, and customs differed from those of our African relatives. While my siblings and I were fluent in Japanese, our cousins struggled to even understand the basics of the language. This language barrier and cultural divide made it challenging for us to connect with our extended family, and we often felt like outsiders at family gatherings. Even as we grew older, this divide proved to be long-lasting. While our cousins pursued careers in medicine and law, we chose to continue our study of Japanese culture and language, which only further separated us from our African relatives. Despite this mundane issue, I couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness at the lack of understanding and connection between our two cultures.
