It was that time of the year again - the annual international conference on physical wellness. This year, the event was being held in North America, and delegates from all over the world had gathered to discuss mundane issues related to physical health. However, what was supposed to be a routine conference turned into a catastrophic situation when a massive earthquake hit the region. The tremors were so severe that the entire conference center collapsed, trapping many attendees inside. Emergency services were immediately called, but the destruction was so extensive that it took several hours for the rescue teams to reach the victims. The incident was a stark reminder of how even the most routine events can turn into disasters in the blink of an eye.
