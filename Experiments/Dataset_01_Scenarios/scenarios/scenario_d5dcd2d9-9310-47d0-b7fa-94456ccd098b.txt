The rise of social media has given the public an extra platform to express their political views, resulting in a deeply divided North America. The irreversible damage caused by online political discussions has created a social challenge that seems impossible to overcome. People have become so entrenched in their beliefs that they are unwilling to listen to opposing viewpoints, leading to a toxic environment where name-calling and personal attacks have become the norm. This polarization has even spilled over into everyday life, with friendships and family relationships being strained or even destroyed due to political differences. The extra layer of anonymity provided by online platforms has made it easier for people to say things they wouldn't normally say in person, exacerbating the problem. The future of North America's political discourse hangs in the balance as the divide grows wider every day.
