In a small village in South Asia, the villagers had always been passionate about sports. They would gather every weekend to play cricket, football, and other games. However, recently they had started facing a disruptive problem. Their chosen family of sports equipment, which had been with them for generations, had started to fail. The balls would deflate mid-game, the bats would break, and the goalposts would fall apart. The villagers knew that they needed to upgrade their equipment, but they were hesitant to embrace technology. They believed that the joy of sports lay in the simplicity of the game and that bringing in technology would take away from the philosophical aspect of sport. But with every passing week, the situation became more dire, and they realized they needed to adapt to the changing times to continue enjoying their beloved pastime.
