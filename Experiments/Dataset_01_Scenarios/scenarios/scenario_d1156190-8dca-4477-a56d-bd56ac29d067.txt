Living in the Pacific region comes with its fair share of natural disasters, and unfortunately, I was struck by one of them. As the winds howled and the rain poured, I found myself huddled in my home, trying to stay calm. But the annoyance came when I realized I had left my wallet in the car, which was now parked outside in the midst of the storm. I desperately needed my ID card, as well as my credit cards, but going outside was not an option. I felt a wave of frustration wash over me as I tried to think of a way to retrieve my wallet without putting myself in danger. The emotional turmoil of the situation was overwhelming, but I knew that I had to remain patient and wait for the storm to pass.
