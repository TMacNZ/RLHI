The tension in the nuclear family had been building up for weeks. It all started with a simple want, but had escalated to a full-blown argument. The parents had been planning a family vacation to Europe for months, and the kids were eagerly looking forward to it. However, the younger child had expressed a strong desire to visit an amusement park instead. This had caused a rift between the parents, with one insisting that the family should stick to the original plan while the other was sympathetic to the child's want. As the argument raged on, emotions ran high, with each parent trying to convince the other of the merits of their point of view. The atmosphere was thick with frustration and disappointment, and it seemed as if the family would never be able to come to a consensus.
