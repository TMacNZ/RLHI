In a typical nuclear family in Asia, an ethical dilemma arose regarding the treatment of an uncle who had committed a heinous crime. The uncle had been convicted of a serious offense and was serving time in prison. However, the family was divided on whether or not to cut ties with him completely. On one hand, some believed that family loyalty was paramount and that they should stand by their uncle through thick and thin. On the other hand, others felt that they had a moral obligation to distance themselves from someone who had committed such a terrible act. This philosophical debate caused tension and conflict within the family, with each side passionately defending their position. Ultimately, they had to grapple with the question of whether familial bonds should always outweigh moral principles.
