The Al-Masri family, living in a small town in North Africa, had always placed great importance on their Islamic faith. However, recent events had caused a serious disagreement within the family. The father, Ali, felt it was his obligation to ensure that his children were raised with strict adherence to Islamic practices and beliefs. His wife, Fatima, agreed with him to some extent, but felt that their teenage daughter, Aisha, should have more freedom to make her own choices about her spirituality. Aisha had been expressing doubts about her faith and had even started questioning some of the teachings she had grown up with. This caused tension between Ali and Fatima, as they each tried to persuade Aisha to take their side. The disagreement had become so serious that it had even caused a rift between Ali and his brother, who had taken Aisha's side. As the family tried to navigate this difficult situation, they all struggled with their own spiritual beliefs and the obligation they felt to their family and community.
