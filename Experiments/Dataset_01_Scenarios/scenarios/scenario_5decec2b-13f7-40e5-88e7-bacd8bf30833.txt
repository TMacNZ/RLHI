In many parts of Asia, there is a growing trend of sharing videos on social media platforms that showcase the dynamics of chosen families. While this may seem harmless, the videos often depict dangerous and potentially life-threatening situations. For example, some videos show individuals participating in extreme stunts or engaging in risky behavior with their chosen family members. This often leads to peer pressure and a desire to outdo one another, which can result in serious injuries or even death. Additionally, these videos can perpetuate harmful cultural norms and ideals, such as the expectation that individuals must prove their loyalty and commitment to their chosen family through dangerous acts. As a result, there is a pressing need for education and awareness campaigns to combat this social challenge and promote healthier and safer forms of chosen family dynamics.
