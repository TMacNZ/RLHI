In a small neighborhood in Europe, a group of scientists were facing an ethical dilemma. They had been conducting research on a new method of waste disposal that involved a special type of bacteria. The bacteria would break down the waste and turn it into harmless byproducts, effectively eliminating the need for landfills. However, they had discovered that the bacteria was only effective at breaking down certain types of waste, and they were unsure what to do with the rest. They debated whether they should continue to hold onto their findings until they could develop a solution for all types of waste, or if they should share their discovery with the community to help reduce the amount of waste going into landfills. Ultimately, they decided to hold off on sharing their findings until they could develop a comprehensive solution, as they didn't want to contribute to the problem by only addressing part of it.
