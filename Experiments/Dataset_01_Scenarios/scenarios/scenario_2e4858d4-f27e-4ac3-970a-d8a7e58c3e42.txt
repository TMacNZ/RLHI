The sound of fists hitting flesh echoed through the empty office building, as two co-workers engaged in a violent physical altercation. The conflict had been brewing for weeks, with both individuals vying for the same promotion. Tensions had reached a boiling point earlier that day, and now the Pacific sunset cast an eerie orange glow on the scene. Desks had been overturned, papers littered the floor, and blood stained the carpet. It was a disruptive disruption to the otherwise professional environment. The altercation only came to an end when security arrived and separated the two combatants. As they were escorted out, both individuals were left with bruises, cuts, and damaged reputations. The incident would surely have lasting consequences for both their careers.
