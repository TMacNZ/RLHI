Angelo, a passionate Italian student, was attending a prestigious Eurasian university, where he had formed a close-knit group of friends. They were all working together on an important educational project, but things quickly turned sour when they couldn't agree on certain aspects of their work. Angelo, known for his fiery temperament, got into a catastrophic argument with his group members. He insisted that his Italian perspective was the only way to approach the project, while the others argued that they needed to take a more global approach. The disagreement became so heated that the group ultimately split, leaving Angelo to work on his own. He was devastated, feeling isolated and alone in a foreign country. As he struggled to complete the project, he realized the importance of compromise and understanding different viewpoints, a lesson that he would never forget.
