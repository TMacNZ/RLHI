In a North American city, an ethical dilemma has arisen regarding the licensing of a new business. The business in question is a gun store, and while it would bring in revenue for the city, some residents are concerned about the potential danger it poses. The city council is split on the issue, with some arguing that the store would create jobs and boost the local economy, while others worry about the implications of promoting the sale of deadly weapons. The severity of the situation is heightened by recent incidents of gun violence in the region, leading to a heated debate between the two sides. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to grant the gun store a license rests on the council's ability to balance economic concerns with the safety and well-being of their constituents.
