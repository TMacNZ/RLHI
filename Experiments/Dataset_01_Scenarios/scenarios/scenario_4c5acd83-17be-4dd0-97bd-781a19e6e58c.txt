In South Asia, the extended family was gathering for a special occasion. As the family members came together, there was a noticeable annoyance brewing amongst them due to an environmental issue. The issue at hand was the lack of meaning placed on the importance of preserving the natural environment. This lack of awareness was causing harm to the environment and impacting the region's natural resources. Some family members were frustrated with the way their own family members were acting, as they continued to litter and use plastic without any consideration for the environment. This was causing a rift in the family, with some feeling that it was their responsibility to educate their relatives on the importance of environmental conservation. As the day wore on, tensions rose, and the family members couldn't help but feel frustrated with the lack of awareness of the issue at hand.
