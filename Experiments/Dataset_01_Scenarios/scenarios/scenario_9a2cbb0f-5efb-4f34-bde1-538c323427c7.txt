The disagreement between the two political leaders of the neighboring countries in Asia had escalated to an unprecedented level. The source of the argument was the revenue generated by the continental trade between the two countries. Each leader claimed that their country was not getting a fair share of the revenue, and that the other country was benefiting more from the trade. The argument had become so intense that it threatened to disrupt the entire continental trade network, causing economic instability in the region. Despite several rounds of negotiations, the leaders were unable to reach a consensus, and tensions continued to rise. The situation had become a cause of concern for the neighboring countries, as the disagreement could potentially lead to a full-blown conflict.
