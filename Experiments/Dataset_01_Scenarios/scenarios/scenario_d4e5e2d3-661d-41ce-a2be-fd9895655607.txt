The concept of AI control problem has been keeping me up at night. As an individual living in North America, it's a serious concern that's been on the rise in recent years. With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, there's a risk that the technology could surpass our ability to control it. The thought of a rogue AI wreaking havoc on humanity is a nightmare scenario. It's an intellectual problem that requires urgent attention before it's too late. As much as I'm fascinated by the possibilities of AI, I'm also acutely aware of the dangers it poses. It's a delicate balance that we must strike, and I hope that we can find a solution before it's too late.
