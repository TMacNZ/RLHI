In Europe, there is a growing concern about the long-lasting effects of excessive visual stimulation. With the rise of technology and screens in our daily lives, people are spending more time than ever staring at screens, leading to a range of health issues. The political domain has gotten involved as well, with discussions on how to regulate screen time and promote healthier habits. The severity of the issue is not to be underestimated, as prolonged visual stimulation has been linked to vision problems, headaches, and even depression. The global scope of this issue is also not to be ignored, as many countries around the world are facing similar challenges. It will be important for policymakers to consider the impact of technology on our health and well-being, and work towards finding solutions to this growing concern.
