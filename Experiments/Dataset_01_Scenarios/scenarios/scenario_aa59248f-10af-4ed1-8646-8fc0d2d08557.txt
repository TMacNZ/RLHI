Despite their love for each other, Jane and John could never see eye to eye on the issue of climate change. Jane, an environmentalist, was convinced that the world was on the brink of disaster and that immediate action was necessary. John, on the other hand, was skeptical of the science behind climate change and believed that the issue had been blown out of proportion. Their arguments on the subject became more frequent and heated as time went on, with neither side willing to back down. Even when they tried to avoid the topic, it would inevitably come up and the tension between them would still be palpable. Their relationship had become strained, and they both knew that the issue of climate change would continue to be a point of contention for as long as they were together.
