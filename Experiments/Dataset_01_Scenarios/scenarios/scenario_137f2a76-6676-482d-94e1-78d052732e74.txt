As a teacher in a small Eurasian town, I faced an ethical dilemma when two of my students, Anna and Maria, submitted identical essays for a class assignment. Upon further investigation, I discovered that the girls had worked together to come up with a combination of ideas and then submitted the same paper as their own. While I was annoyed by their lack of effort and integrity, I also recognized that this was a teaching moment. I sat down with Anna and Maria and explained the importance of academic honesty and the consequences of plagiarism. We discussed alternative approaches they could have taken and how they could work together without copying each other's work. It was a difficult conversation, but I felt it was necessary to instill a sense of responsibility and accountability in my students.
