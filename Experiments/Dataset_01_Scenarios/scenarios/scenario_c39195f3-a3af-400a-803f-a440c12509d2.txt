The issue of emission has been a disruptive challenge for countries all over the world, particularly in the Eurasian region. As a physical problem, the emission of harmful gases into the atmosphere has led to a range of social challenges, including health problems for citizens and a negative impact on the environment. Countries have struggled to come up with solutions to this issue, with some implementing stricter regulations on industries that emit large amounts of gases, while others have invested in renewable energy sources. Despite these efforts, the problem persists and continues to be a major concern for the international community. The need for a coordinated global approach to address this issue is becoming increasingly urgent, as the impacts of emission are felt across borders and affect the entire planet.
