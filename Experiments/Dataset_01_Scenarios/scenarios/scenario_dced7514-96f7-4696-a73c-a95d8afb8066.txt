In the year 2147, humanity had expanded to colonize several planets in the South Pacific region of the galaxy. A package delivery company named Interspace Express was responsible for delivering packages between these planets. One day, a delivery driver discovered that one of the packages they were transporting contained a rare and endangered species of plant, known to only exist on a single planet. The plant was meant to be delivered to a wealthy collector on another planet. The driver was faced with an ethical dilemma - should they deliver the package and potentially contribute to the further endangerment of the species, or should they refuse to deliver it and risk losing their job? The driver contacted their supervisor, who informed them that the company's policy was to deliver all packages, regardless of their contents. The driver then reached out to an environmental organization, who advised them to smuggle the plant to a greenhouse on one of the colonized planets where it could be safely propagated and protected. The driver ultimately decided to smuggle the plant and successfully delivered it to the greenhouse. However, the driver was fired from their job for violating company policy. The incident sparked a larger conversation about the ethics of intergalactic package delivery and the responsibility companies have to protect endangered species.
