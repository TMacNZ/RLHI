The national government had been neglecting the maintenance of the technological infrastructure in the Pacific region for years, and it was starting to show. The dangerous consequences of their inaction were now becoming clear. The social impact of the technological failure was felt across the region, as power grids failed and communication systems went down. People were left in the dark, literally and figuratively, as they struggled to go about their daily lives. The lack of maintenance had led to a domino effect of failures, and the situation was growing more dire by the minute. It was clear that the national government needed to take immediate action to address the issue, before any more harm was done.
