The national or federal agreement that aimed to resolve the critical conflict in the Middle East was jeopardized by the intellectual property dispute. The two sides had reached a tentative agreement after months of negotiations, but a sudden disagreement over the ownership of a key intellectual property threatened to derail the entire process. The dispute centered around a technology patent that had been developed jointly by both sides, and which was seen as critical to the success of the agreement. The federal negotiators were convinced that the patent belonged to them, while the national representatives claimed equal ownership. As tensions rose, fears grew that the entire process could break down, plunging the region into renewed conflict and violence. Both sides were determined to hold their ground, and it seemed that only a creative solution or a third-party intervention could prevent the situation from escalating further.
