As a family, we always believed that protecting the environment was the best thing we could do for ourselves and for future generations. But living in South Asia, we were faced with a serious problem. The air pollution levels in our city were at an all-time high, and it was affecting our health in ways we never imagined. My parents, who were both intellectuals, took it upon themselves to research and find ways to combat this environmental issue. We started by investing in air purifiers and masks, but soon realized that simply protecting ourselves wasn't enough. We needed to take action to reduce our carbon footprint and make a positive impact on the environment. So, we decided to start a composting project in our backyard and plant trees in our community. It wasn't easy, but we were determined to do our best to create a healthier environment for ourselves and our neighbors. And while we still have a long way to go, we know that every small step counts, and we're proud to be doing our part to make a difference.
