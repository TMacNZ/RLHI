In the year 3050, the Intergalactic Council declared a state of emergency in Subsaharan Africa due to a critical philosophical conflict that had erupted. It all started with a simple ad campaign promoting a new brand of consciousness-altering drugs. The ad featured a group of people from different races and cultures, all smiling and holding hands, with the tagline "One mind, one world." However, the ad sparked controversy among some groups who saw it as promoting the erasure of cultural differences and the creation of a monolithic society. This led to protests and counter-protests, which quickly turned violent. Soon, factions emerged on both sides of the debate, with some advocating for a globalized, homogenized society and others fighting for the preservation of cultural diversity. The conflict escalated to the point where armed militias were formed, and entire cities were destroyed in the ensuing battles. The Intergalactic Council, realizing the severity of the situation, sent peacekeeping forces to the region and convened a series of talks to try and resolve the conflict. However, the deep-seated philosophical differences proved difficult to reconcile, and the peace talks ultimately failed. The conflict raged on for years, causing untold suffering and loss of life, until a new generation emerged that was willing to listen and find common ground.
