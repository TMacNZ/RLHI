In a small town in Asia, a large extended family was preparing for a family gathering. However, tensions were high due to a recent political scandal that had rocked the country. One of the family members, who held a high-ranking political position, was accused of accepting bribes in exchange for political favors. The atmosphere at the family gathering was tense as some family members believed that the accused member was innocent, while others believed that they were guilty and should be punished. The ethical dilemma arose when the family members were debating whether or not to publicly support the accused member. On one hand, they wanted to support their family member, but on the other hand, they did not want to condone corrupt behavior. The severity of the situation was not extreme, but it was an annoyance for the family as they struggled to navigate the political scandal within their own family.
