The Lee family was preparing for their winter vacation in Japan. As they were packing their bags, Mrs. Lee noticed that her husband, Mr. Lee, had packed his old coat that he had been wearing for the past five winters.

"Are you seriously going to wear that old coat again, dear?" Mrs. Lee asked, with a hint of annoyance in her voice.

"What's wrong with it? It still keeps me warm," Mr. Lee replied defensively.

"We are going to Japan, not Antarctica. You can't wear that same old coat every year. It's time to buy a new one," Mrs. Lee retorted.

"I don't want to spend money on a new coat when this one works perfectly fine," Mr. Lee countered.

Their children, Jenny and Michael, watched the argument unfold. They knew that their parents often disagreed about money matters.

"Mom, can't we just buy dad a new coat? It's not that expensive," Jenny suggested.

Mrs. Lee sighed. "It's not just about the coat, Jenny. Your father and I have different views on how to manage our finances. We need to talk about it more."

The family continued to pack their bags in silence. While they were excited for their vacation, the argument over the coat had left a sour taste in their mouths. They knew that they would have to address the underlying economic disagreement when they returned home.
