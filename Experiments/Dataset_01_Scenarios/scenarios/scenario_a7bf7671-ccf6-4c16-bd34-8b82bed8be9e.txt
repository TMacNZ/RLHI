The world had been transformed by the latest generation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. AI had revolutionized industries and transformed the way people lived, worked and interacted with each other. However, in Subsaharan Africa, the impact of AI was not evenly distributed. While some countries had embraced the technology and made significant strides in economic development, others had been left behind.

In this region, the long-lasting effects of the AI control problem were felt most acutely. With the rise of automation and AI-driven systems, many traditional jobs had disappeared, leaving large swathes of the population without work. Governments struggled to come up with solutions to this problem and provide alternative means of employment.

The economic domain was hit the hardest, with many small businesses closing down due to competition from more efficient AI-driven enterprises. The younger generation, who had grown up with technology, were the most affected. They struggled to find work and often resorted to informal, low-paying jobs.

The severity of the situation was not lost on the international community, who recognized the need for urgent action. Aid organizations and governments from around the world came together to provide support and resources to the region. They recognized that the impact of the AI control problem was not limited to Subsaharan Africa and that a global solution was needed.

As the years went by, the region slowly began to recover. Governments invested in education and training programs to equip their citizens with the skills needed to thrive in a world dominated by AI. The younger generation, who had borne the brunt of the crisis, became the most innovative, creating new businesses and industries that leveraged the latest technology.

In the end, the AI control problem had a profound and long-lasting impact on Subsaharan Africa. However, with the support of the international community and the resilience of the local population, the region was able to overcome the challenges and emerge stronger and more prosperous than ever before.
