Last week, a video of a political rally in Asia went viral online. The footage showed a group of supporters waving flags and chanting slogans as they marched through the streets. Suddenly, a stick flew out of nowhere and struck one of the participants in the head, causing him to stumble and fall to the ground. The incident was caught on camera by several bystanders and quickly spread across social media. Many people were outraged by the senseless act of violence and called for the perpetrator to be held accountable. The political party responsible for the rally issued a statement condemning the incident and promising to take steps to ensure the safety of all attendees at their events.
