The Johnsons, a nuclear family living in a remote area of Eurasia, were settling into their peaceful routine when they encountered an unexpected disruption. As the father was driving home from work one evening, a deer darted out into the road, causing him to swerve and crash into a ditch. Thankfully, he was able to walk away from the accident with only minor injuries, but the car was badly damaged and would require extensive repairs. Without a vehicle, the family was unable to go about their daily activities, such as grocery shopping and taking the children to school. They had to rely on neighbors for rides and deliveries, causing a significant inconvenience. Despite the mundane nature of the issue, the Johnsons were reminded of the harsh realities of living in a remote area with limited resources.
