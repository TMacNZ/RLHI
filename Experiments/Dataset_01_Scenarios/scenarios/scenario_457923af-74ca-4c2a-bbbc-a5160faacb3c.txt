It was a typical school day in South Asia, with students logging on to their online classes due to the ongoing pandemic. However, one particular incident left everyone in shock and disbelief. A serious accident occurred during an online biology class when a student's pet buck suddenly jumped onto the keyboard, causing the laptop to fall off the desk and onto the student's foot. The student let out a bloodcurdling scream as the teacher and classmates watched in horror. The teacher quickly called for an ambulance, while the rest of the class tried to calm the student down. It was a difficult situation, as the online format made it challenging to provide immediate medical assistance. The incident served as a stark reminder of the potential dangers of online learning and the need for proper safety measures, even in the comfort of one's own home.
