It was a sunny afternoon when the devastating earthquake struck the park where I was taking a leisurely walk. Suddenly, the ground started shaking violently, and trees were uprooted, falling all around me. People were screaming and running in all directions, trying to escape the chaotic scene. I tried to run towards the exit, but the path was blocked by huge rocks and debris. I realized that I was trapped, and my life was in grave danger. As the tremors continued, I clung onto a tree for dear life, hoping and praying that I would survive this natural disaster. It was a terrifying experience that I will never forget.
