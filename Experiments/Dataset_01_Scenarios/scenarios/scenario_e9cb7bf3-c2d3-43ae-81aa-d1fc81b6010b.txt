In a global legal issue that has caused disruption in North America, a mundane problem has arisen with the use of the word "like" in legal documents. Lawyers and judges have been using the word in a colloquial sense, leading to confusion and misinterpretation of legal language. This has resulted in several cases being delayed or dismissed due to the ambiguity of the word "like." The severity of this issue has been felt across the legal domain, with experts calling for a clear definition and standardization of the use of "like" in legal documents. This situation has highlighted the importance of precision and clarity in legal language, and the need to avoid using informal language in formal documents. Legal professionals are now working to resolve this issue and ensure that the use of language in legal documents is consistent and unambiguous.
