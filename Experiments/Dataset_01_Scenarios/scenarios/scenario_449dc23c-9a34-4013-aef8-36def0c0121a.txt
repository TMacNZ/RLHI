It had been a long and tiring shift at the call center. Ivan had been answering calls for hours, trying his best to sound cheerful and helpful to the customers on the other end of the line. But his mind was starting to wander, and his eyes were drooping with fatigue. He glanced at the clock on his computer screen and saw that he still had a few more hours to go before his shift was over. He sighed and rubbed his eyes, wishing he could just crawl into bed and sleep for a week. But he knew he had bills to pay, so he soldiered on. As he reached for his mouse to answer the next call, he noticed something strange happening on his computer screen. The colors were shifting and warping, and the cursor was moving on its own. He tried to click on the disconnect button, but his mouse wouldn't respond. Panic set in as he realized that something was seriously wrong with his computer. He frantically searched for a solution, but nothing worked. He knew he had to report the issue, but he also knew that it would take a long time to get it fixed. This was going to be a long-lasting problem, and he had no idea how he was going to get through the rest of his shift without a working computer.
