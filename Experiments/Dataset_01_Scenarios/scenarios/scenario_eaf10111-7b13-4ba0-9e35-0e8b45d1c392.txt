In the bustling city of Dubai, two friends were having a conversation while enjoying a meal at a local restaurant. One of them had a sudden sneezing fit, causing the other to worry. It turns out that the friend had a health concern related to pepper, which was present in the dish they were sharing. The friend had a mild allergy to pepper, and the severity of the reaction was typical for them. However, the situation was exacerbated by the fact that the restaurant used a new technological process to grind the pepper, making it more potent than usual. The friend's eyes were watery, and their throat felt scratchy. The other friend quickly flagged down a waiter to ask for assistance while handing their friend a glass of water. The waiter informed them that the restaurant used a special kind of pepper grinder that could be adjusted to grind the pepper more finely or coarsely. The friends decided to request that the pepper be ground more coarsely in the future to avoid any further health concerns.
