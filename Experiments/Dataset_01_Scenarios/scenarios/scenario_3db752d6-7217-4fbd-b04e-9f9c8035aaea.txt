In South Asia, the definition of chosen family is often closely tied to spiritual or religious beliefs. This can lead to disagreements and annoyances when one member of the chosen family holds a different belief system than the others. Such was the case with the Patel family. They had been a tight-knit group for years, but when Rohit, the youngest member, converted to a different faith, tensions rose. Rohit's new beliefs conflicted with some of the rituals and practices that the Patels had always observed. His family members felt hurt and bewildered that he would choose to stray from their shared spiritual path. However, Rohit remained firm in his conviction and refused to compromise on his newfound faith. This led to heated arguments and hurt feelings, but eventually, the Patels found a way to respect each other's beliefs and continue to love each other as chosen family.
