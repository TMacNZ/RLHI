It was a hot summer day in South Asia when the extended family gathered at their domestic compound for a family reunion. As they enjoyed a homemade feast, the children ran around playing tag and hide-and-seek. Suddenly, a critical incident occurred that would forever change their lives. One of the younger children accidentally knocked over a lantern, igniting a nearby pile of dry leaves and kindling. The flames quickly spread, engulfing the entire compound in a matter of minutes. The family frantically tried to put out the fire, but it was too late. The severity of the situation became apparent as they realized that the entire compound was destroyed, leaving them with nothing but the clothes on their backs. As they stood in shock and disbelief, the environmental impact of the fire became evident with the thick smoke and ash clouding the sky. The family was left to pick up the pieces and rebuild their lives from scratch, forever haunted by the memory of that fateful day.
