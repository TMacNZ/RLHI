The faculty meeting at the Pacific university took a heated turn when the topic of certification requirements for new hires came up. The department heads disagreed on whether they should require a specific certification or merely prefer it. The argument grew disruptive as voices raised and accusations flew. The educational domain was at stake, and each side was convinced that their approach was the only viable one. The tension in the room was palpable, and it took the dean's intervention to bring the conversation back to a productive level. Eventually, a compromise was reached, but the disagreement left a mark on the faculty, and some lingering resentment remained.
