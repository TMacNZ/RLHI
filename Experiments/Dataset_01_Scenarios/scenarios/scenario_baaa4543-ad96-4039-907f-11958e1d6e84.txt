At the small school in a rural town in South America, the sound of the bell was a familiar sound to all students and teachers. It signaled the start and end of class periods, as well as lunch breaks. However, on this particular day, the bell was not functioning properly. It was ringing randomly throughout the day, causing a great deal of annoyance and confusion. Students and teachers alike were uncertain when class periods began and ended, and the irregular ringing disrupted their concentration. The principal attempted to repair the bell, but to no avail. Eventually, they were forced to resort to using a makeshift system of shouting and hand signals to indicate the start and end of class periods. Despite the inconvenience, everyone remained focused on their education, determined to make the best of the situation.
