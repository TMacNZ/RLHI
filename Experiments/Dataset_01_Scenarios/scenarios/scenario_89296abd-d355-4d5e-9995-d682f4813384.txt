It was the anniversary of their chosen family's founding, and they had planned a big celebration. However, they were hit by a disruptive financial crisis that was impacting the entire Middle East region.

They decided to pool their resources and invest in more stable areas like real estate and commodities. It was a difficult time, but their chosen family's bond and commitment to each other helped them get through it. They emerged from the crisis stronger and more resilient than ever, ready to face any challenge that came their way.
