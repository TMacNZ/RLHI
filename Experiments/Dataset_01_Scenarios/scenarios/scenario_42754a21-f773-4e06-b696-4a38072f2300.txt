At the edge of the universe, something catastrophic has happened that has long-lasting implications for South Asia. A massive environmental issue has arisen, caused by the political decisions made by the leaders of the region. The consequences are dire, and the people are suffering. The air is thick with pollution, making it difficult to breathe or even see. The water is contaminated, causing illness and death. The land is barren and unable to sustain life. The once vibrant and thriving cities are now ghost towns, with people fleeing in search of a better life. The political leaders are scrambling to find a solution, but their efforts seem futile. The damage is too great, and the effects will be felt for generations to come. The people of South Asia are left to pick up the pieces, wondering how their leaders could have let things get so bad.
