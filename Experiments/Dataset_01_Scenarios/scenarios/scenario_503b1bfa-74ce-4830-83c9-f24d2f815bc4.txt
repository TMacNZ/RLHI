Rajesh was known for his practical jokes, and his family had grown accustomed to his shenanigans. One evening, when they were all gathered together for dinner, Rajesh decided to play a prank on his father. He slipped a small amount of a toxic chemical into his father's drink, thinking it would make him feel sick for a little while. However, the chemical turned out to be much more potent than Rajesh had anticipated. Within minutes, his father was gasping for air, and the rest of the family realized that something was seriously wrong. They rushed him to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with severe poisoning. The doctors were able to stabilize him, but it was touch-and-go for a few hours. Rajesh was wracked with guilt over what he had done, and his family was furious with him. They couldn't believe he would risk his father's life just for a joke. The incident shook them all deeply, and it took a long time for the family to recover from the trauma.
