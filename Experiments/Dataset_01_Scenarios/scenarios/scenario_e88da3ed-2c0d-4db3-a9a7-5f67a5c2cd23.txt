In the year 2050, humanity had achieved intergalactic travel and settlements on multiple planets. However, their actions on Earth had irreversible consequences. Yet, despite the warnings of environmentalists, corporations continued to exploit the planet's natural resources, leading to a catastrophic event in South America. One of the largest mining corporations had been extracting rare minerals from the Amazon rainforest, causing irreparable damage to the ecosystem. The mining activities had contaminated the water sources and destroyed the habitats of countless species, leading to a rapid decline in biodiversity. The corporation had ignored regulations and warnings from environmental organizations, focusing solely on profits. Now, the damage was done, and there was no going back. The once-lush rainforest had turned into a barren wasteland, and the indigenous people had lost their homes and livelihoods. The intergalactic community was stunned by the devastation caused by human greed and negligence, and they vowed to take action to prevent such incidents from happening again.
