The world is facing a dangerous social challenge that has been amplified by technological advancements, particularly in Asia. The issue at hand is the over-reliance on technology, which has significantly affected people's ability to interact with each other in meaningful ways. The constant use of social media and other gadgets has led to a decline in face-to-face communication, and people are now more isolated than ever before. This has created a global problem that needs to be addressed urgently before it's too late. In Asia, where technology is highly integrated into daily life, the situation is even more severe. The over-dependence on technology has led to increased mental health issues, reduced productivity, and social isolation, leaving people feeling disconnected and unfulfilled. Unless we find a way to balance our use of technology with real-world interactions, we risk creating a world where people are more connected to their devices than to each other.
