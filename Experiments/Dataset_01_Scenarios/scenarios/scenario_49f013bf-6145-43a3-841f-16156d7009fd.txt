In the South Pacific, a chosen family of five had always lived in a house with a beautiful garden surrounded by a wall. However, one day, they woke up to find that a huge section of the wall had collapsed, leaving a gaping hole in its place. The family was devastated as they knew that the wall was critical to their safety and security. They had always relied on the wall to protect them from the harsh environmental conditions of the South Pacific. Without the wall, they were exposed to strong winds and heavy rains that could potentially damage their home. The family knew that they had to act fast to fix the wall, but they were faced with a social challenge. They didn't have the resources to repair the wall on their own, and they didn't have any friends or relatives nearby who could lend a helping hand. The family felt helpless and vulnerable, not knowing what to do next. They knew that they had to find a way to fix the wall before it was too late.
