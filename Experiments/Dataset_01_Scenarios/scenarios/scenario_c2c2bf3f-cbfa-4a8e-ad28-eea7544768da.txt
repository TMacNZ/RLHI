In a small town nestled in the heart of South America, a heated disagreement has erupted among the members of a religious community. At the foundation of the dispute lies a fundamental disagreement about the interpretation of their shared spiritual beliefs. The severity of the situation is disruptive, as the community members have grown increasingly divided and tensions continue to rise. Those on either side of the argument are fiercely passionate about their perspective, and discussions have become heated and often confrontational. As the days pass, it becomes clear that this rift threatens to fracture the community, leaving each individual grappling with the difficult decision of whether to stay and fight for their beliefs or leave in search of a more harmonious environment.
