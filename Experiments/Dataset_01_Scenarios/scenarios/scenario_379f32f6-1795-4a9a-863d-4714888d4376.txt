In the not-too-distant future, interstellar travel has become a reality, and humanity has expanded far beyond the confines of Earth. However, a serious legal issue has arisen in South Asia, threatening to destabilize the delicate balance of power in the region. The fact is that several interstellar corporations have been exploiting the resources of the region without proper authorization or compensation, leading to widespread anger and resentment among the local population. The situation has escalated to the point where some factions are calling for the expulsion of all off-world entities from the region, while others argue that a more measured approach is necessary to avoid damaging the region's economy. Amidst all of this, legal experts from across the galaxy are weighing in on the matter, attempting to find a solution that will satisfy both the locals and the corporations. It remains to be seen whether a satisfactory resolution can be reached, or if tensions will continue to simmer in the region.
