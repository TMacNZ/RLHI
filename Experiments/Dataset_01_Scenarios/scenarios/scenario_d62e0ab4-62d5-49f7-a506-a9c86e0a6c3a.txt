As a resident of the Pacific region, I have experienced my fair share of natural disasters, from typhoons to earthquakes. But the annoyance that I always face after each disaster is the lack of resolution from the government and aid organizations. Donations pour in from around the world, but it seems like they never reach the people who need them most. The social fallout of this lack of aid is disastrous - people become desperate and turn to looting and violence. As an individual, I try my best to help my community, but it feels like a drop in the bucket compared to the massive task at hand. I can only hope that the government and aid organizations will step up their efforts to provide the necessary resources to those affected by these natural disasters.
