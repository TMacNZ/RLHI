In the year 3021, intergalactic travel had become a norm, and humans had colonized various planets across the universe. However, a recent discovery had caused a huge ethical dilemma, which could potentially disrupt the entire region of the South Pacific. Scientists had uncovered a new planet that had an abundance of resources that could solve the current environmental crisis on Earth. The catch was that this planet was inhabited by a highly intelligent alien species that had built an advanced civilization. The question was, should humans exploit this planet's resources and potentially wipe out an entire species for the betterment of their own? The situation was dire, and the leaders of the human colonies were struggling to find a justifiable explanation for their actions. The question that lingered was, should we prioritize our own survival over the right to life of an intelligent species?
