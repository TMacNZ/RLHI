As humanity ventured further into the cosmos, the need for interstellar cooperation became increasingly apparent. However, a disruptive disagreement arose when a team of scientists from Subsaharan Africa claimed to have discovered a way to complete intergalactic travel without the use of expensive and scarce resources. Their breakthrough sparked intense debate among the international scientific community, with some arguing that it was a revolutionary breakthrough that could change the course of human history, while others dismissed it as a fanciful and untested theory. The social implications of this argument were significant, as it threatened to upend the existing power structures within the scientific community and potentially widen the economic gap between nations who could afford interstellar travel and those who could not.
