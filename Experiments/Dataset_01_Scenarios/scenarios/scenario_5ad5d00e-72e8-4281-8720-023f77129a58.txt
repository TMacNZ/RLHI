It was a chilly evening in the small village of Subsaharan Africa. The extended family had gathered to celebrate the arrival of their eldest member who had come all the way from another village. As they sat around the fire, sipping on tea and exchanging stories, they noticed that the fire was not providing enough heat to keep them warm. They checked the stove, but it was working perfectly fine. After some investigation, they realized that the generator, which powered the electric heater, had stopped working due to a technical failure. The family tried to repair it themselves, but it was beyond their expertise. This technological failure was becoming an annoyance as the cold was seeping into their bones. The eldest member suggested that they use traditional methods to keep warm, and they all agreed. They brought out warm blankets and shawls, and huddled together around the fire. As they sat close, sharing warmth, they realized that sometimes, the old ways were the best ways, especially in a cultural context.
