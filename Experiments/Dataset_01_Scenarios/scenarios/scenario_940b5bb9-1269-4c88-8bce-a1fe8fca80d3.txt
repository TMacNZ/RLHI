The urban landscape of North America was plunged into chaos when a massive technological failure occurred. The disruption was felt in every major city, as traffic lights malfunctioned, public transportation systems shut down, and communication networks collapsed. People were stranded without a way to get home or contact loved ones, and emergency services were overwhelmed with calls. The failure was so widespread and severe that it even affected cultural events, with concerts and performances being cancelled due to the inability to properly manage crowds. The international community was left stunned as they watched North America struggle to regain control over the situation. It was a stark reminder of just how reliant we have become on technology in our day-to-day lives.
