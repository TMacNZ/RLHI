The retirement of the senior executive in the Asia division of a multinational corporation was marred by a dangerous disagreement that stemmed from cultural differences. As the executive prepared to retire, a heated argument broke out between the local team and the expat team over the distribution of the executive's responsibilities. The local team felt that they had been overlooked and that the expat team was taking over too much control. The expat team, on the other hand, believed they had been brought in specifically to manage the transition and ensure a smooth handover. Tensions rose as the disagreement escalated, with both sides refusing to back down. The situation became so severe that the local team threatened to go on strike if the expat team did not relinquish control. Eventually, a compromise was reached, but the incident highlighted the challenges that can arise when cultural differences are not fully understood and respected in a professional setting.
