In the aftermath of a devastating natural disaster in Subsaharan Africa, tensions rise as communities try to negotiate access to limited resources. The disaster has left many without homes, food, or clean water, and the political climate is already tense. The disruption caused by the disaster has exacerbated existing grievances, and people are struggling to find common ground in negotiations. The lack of resources has led to a rise in crime and violence, further complicating the negotiations. Political leaders are under pressure to find a solution that benefits everyone, but progress is slow and tensions continue to simmer. As the situation becomes more desperate, some fear that the negotiations may break down completely, leading to even greater unrest and suffering.
