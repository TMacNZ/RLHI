The year is 2207 and intergalactic travel has become the norm. However, tensions have been rising between the North African Alliance and the Galactic Federation over access to resources on a nearby planet. The airline industry has been hit hard by the conflict, as flights are frequently delayed or cancelled due to the dangerous airspace over the region. The danger is not just from enemy spacecraft, but also from local cultural groups who are fighting for their independence from both the Alliance and the Federation. Pilots must navigate through a maze of no-fly zones and anti-aircraft fire, all while trying to avoid collisions with other spacecraft. Passengers on board are often on edge, not just from the danger, but also from the heightened security measures that have been put in place. It's a tense situation for everyone involved, and the future of intergalactic travel in the region hangs in the balance.
