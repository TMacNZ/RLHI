The sound of the crash echoed through the small apartment as the couch collapsed under the weight of its occupant. It had been a long day at work, and all she wanted to do was relax on the comfort of her own couch. However, as she settled into the cushions, she heard a loud snap, followed by a sudden jolt as the couch gave way beneath her. She fell hard onto the floor, her back and head slamming against the hardwood surface. For several minutes, she lay there in shock, unable to move or even comprehend what had just happened. Slowly, the pain began to set in, and she realized that this accident would have catastrophic consequences. She had suffered a severe spinal injury, one that would require extensive surgery and months of rehabilitation. As she lay there, waiting for help to arrive, she couldn't help but wonder how something as simple as sitting on a couch could change her life forever.
