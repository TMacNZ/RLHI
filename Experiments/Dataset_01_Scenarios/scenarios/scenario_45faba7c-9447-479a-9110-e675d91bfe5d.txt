Mama Abena was the senior member of the family, respected and revered by all. She had lived through the ups and downs of life and had seen the world change drastically over the years. However, the recent technological failure had disrupted her daily routine, leaving her feeling lost and frustrated.

It had all started when the government had introduced a new system for distributing food subsidies to the elderly in the region. The system relied on biometric authentication, which meant that Mama Abena had to scan her fingerprint at the local distribution center to receive her monthly food package. However, the system had been malfunctioning for weeks, leaving many seniors like Mama Abena without access to their much-needed food supplies.

Mama Abena had tried to get help from her extended family, but they were all struggling to make ends meet themselves. Her granddaughter, Adwoa, had suggested that she try using her smartphone to access the system online. Mama Abena had never used a smartphone before, but Adwoa had patiently taught her how to navigate the system.

Despite her initial reluctance, Mama Abena soon found herself enjoying the new technology. She could now easily check her account balance, reorder food supplies, and even video call her family members who lived far away. She felt connected to the world again and was grateful for Adwoa's help.

However, one day, her smartphone suddenly stopped working, leaving Mama Abena feeling helpless and frustrated. She had become so reliant on technology that she didn't know how to function without it. Adwoa tried to troubleshoot the issue, but it was beyond her expertise. They eventually had to take the phone to a repair shop in the city, which was an expensive and time-consuming process.

The technological failure had disrupted Mama Abena's daily routine and caused her undue stress. However, it had also highlighted the importance of technology in her life and how it had opened up new avenues for social connection and access to vital resources. She was grateful for her family's support and vowed to stay up-to-date with the latest technology so that she could continue to live a fulfilling life.
