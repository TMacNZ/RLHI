Meanwhile, in a quaint little town in South Asia, the Sharma family were having a nice evening dinner when their television suddenly went blank. They tried to turn it back on, but to no avail. It was then that they noticed that all the other electronic devices in the house had also stopped functioning. The father, an engineer by profession, quickly realized that there had been a technological failure in the power grid, causing a temporary blackout. Though insignificant, this event caused a wave of frustration to wash over the entire family, who had grown increasingly reliant on technology for their daily entertainment and communication needs. They spent the rest of the evening playing board games and having heartfelt conversations, realizing that sometimes, the best moments in life are the simplest ones.
