As a wealthy European investor, you have always believed in ethical business practices and have made it a point to only invest in companies that uphold similar values. However, you are faced with a serious ethical dilemma when your chosen family, a cultural group that you have been a part of for years, comes to you asking for financial support. They explain that they are planning to expand their business, which involves the production and distribution of a controversial product that goes against your personal morals. You are torn between your loyalty to your chosen family and your commitment to ethical investing. As you weigh the potential financial gain against the cultural and ethical repercussions, you begin to question if there is a way to support your family without compromising your values.
