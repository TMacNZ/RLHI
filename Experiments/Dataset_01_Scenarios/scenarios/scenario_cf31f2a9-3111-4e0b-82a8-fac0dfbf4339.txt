In the heart of Subsaharan Africa, a family gathering was underway. Cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents had traveled from all over to come together for a special occasion. As they were enjoying a meal outdoors, a heated argument erupted between two cousins over a painting that had been hanging in their grandmother's home for years. One cousin claimed that the painting had been gifted to them by a distant relative and therefore belonged to them, while the other argued that it had been in the family for generations and should remain in their grandmother's possession. The argument quickly escalated to physical violence, causing the entire family to become annoyed and frustrated by the disruption. Despite attempts to diffuse the situation, the two cousins continued to fight over the painting, causing a rift in the family that would take time to heal. As the sun began to set and the family dispersed, the painting remained hanging on the wall, a symbol of the conflict that had arisen over it.
