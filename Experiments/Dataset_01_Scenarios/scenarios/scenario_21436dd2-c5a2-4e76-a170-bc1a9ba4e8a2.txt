Despite the fact that they were not related by blood, the group of friends had formed a strong and unbreakable bond. They had chosen each other as family, and they lived together in a small beach house on the Pacific coast. Nevertheless, their idyllic lifestyle was threatened by a dangerous environmental issue. The sea level was rising rapidly, and the waves were crashing dangerously close to their home. The group had always been philosophical about their connection to each other and the world around them, but now they were forced to confront the harsh reality of their situation. They worked tirelessly to fortify their home, building sandbags and reinforcing the walls. But they knew that their efforts might not be enough to withstand the power of the ocean. As they watched the waves grow stronger and closer, they held onto each other and hoped that their chosen family would be able to weather the storm.
