The National Religious Council of Europe was hosting a massive concert to celebrate the diversity of faiths within their region. The concert was set to feature performers from various spiritual and religious backgrounds. However, the organizers had decided to incorporate an AI control system to manage things like lighting and sound.

As the concert began, the AI system malfunctioned, causing the lighting to flicker and the sound to become distorted. The audience grew restless and began to boo the performers, who were struggling to continue their acts amidst the technical difficulties.

The head of the Religious Council quickly stepped onto the stage and announced that the AI system had been shut down and that the remaining performances would be carried out manually. The crowd erupted in applause as the performers continued without the aid of technology.

After the concert, the Religious Council held an emergency meeting to discuss the malfunction of the AI system. They concluded that while the use of technology can provide many benefits, it should not be relied on entirely to manage important events like this. The Council pledged to be more mindful in the future and to ensure that their events are managed by human operators rather than relying solely on AI.
