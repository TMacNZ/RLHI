In a small village nestled in the heart of Eurasia, a devastating incident had occurred. The village, which relied heavily on welfare support to survive, had encountered a life-threatening situation. One of the main welfare centers had caught fire, trapping dozens of villagers inside. The flames grew rapidly, fueled by the dry thatched roofs of the surrounding huts. The villagers stood helpless as the flames engulfed the welfare center, with no means to control the raging inferno. Panic spread quickly as the fire threatened to spread to nearby homes. The villagers frantically tried to save their loved ones, but the intensity of the fire was too much to handle. The situation quickly turned dire as the local authorities struggled to contain the fire and rescue those trapped inside. The village was left in shock and mourning as they counted the loss of their loved ones and the destruction of their only source of welfare aid.
