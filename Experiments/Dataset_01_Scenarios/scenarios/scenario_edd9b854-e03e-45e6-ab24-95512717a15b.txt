In North America, an ethical dilemma has arisen in the educational domain regarding the use of scales in grading. Across the continent, there have been complaints from students and parents about the fairness of using a traditional scale to determine grades. The argument is that a student's worth should not be reduced to a number, and that grades should instead reflect a student's effort and growth. Some educators have taken steps to address this issue by implementing alternative grading systems, but the debate continues to rage. This annoyance has become a continental issue that is causing a lot of concern among students and educators alike.
