In the far reaches of interstellar space, the leaders of the Eurasian political domain were growing increasingly annoyed by a health concern that seemed to plague their adult population.

The exact nature of the health concern was unclear, with symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to debilitating illness. As the leaders of Eurasia grappled with this issue, they also struggled to maintain their position in the interstellar community. Rumors began to spread that Eurasia was neglecting the health of its citizens, leading to a loss of respect and influence on the galactic stage. With their credibility on the line, the leaders of Eurasia knew they needed to find a solution to this health concern and fast, or risk losing their place in the political hierarchy of the universe.
