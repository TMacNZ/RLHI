As the storm clouds rolled in over the port town in Eurasia, Maria hurried to secure her small fishing boat. She could feel the wind picking up, tugging at her hair and clothes, as she frantically tied down the sails and made sure everything was in place. But it was too late. The gusts became stronger, and soon the rain was pouring down in sheets. Maria huddled under the shelter of her boat, watching as the waves grew taller and more violent. She knew that this was no ordinary storm, and that the port was in danger. As she listened to the sound of the wind howling and the water crashing against the shore, she prayed that her home and her community would be spared from the full force of the natural disaster.
