As conflicts and violence continue to plague communities worldwide, it's important to realize the emotional toll they take on individuals. Even though the severity of this impact may be considered insignificant when compared to physical harm, the psychological scars can be long-lasting. The fear, anxiety, and trauma experienced by those affected by conflict or violence can lead to a range of emotional issues such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and a general sense of mistrust towards others. It's crucial for us to recognize this aspect of the problem and work towards providing safe and supportive environments for those who have been impacted.
