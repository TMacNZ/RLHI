The disruption caused by the mundane issue of inadequate reflection time is being felt in educational institutions across South Asia. Students, already grappling with the challenges of remote learning, are finding it difficult to make sense of the new educational landscape without the opportunity to reflect on their learning. This lack of reflection time has had a significant impact on both their academic progress and overall well-being. Teachers are struggling to find ways to create reflection time within the constraints of the curriculum and the limited attention spans of their students. The severity of this issue is evident in the declining motivation and engagement levels among students. If not addressed, this could have long-term implications for the educational outcomes of the region.
