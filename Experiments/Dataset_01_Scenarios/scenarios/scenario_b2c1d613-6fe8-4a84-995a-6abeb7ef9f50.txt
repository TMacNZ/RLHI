The cultural practice of keeping child brides is a dangerous and emotional social challenge plaguing many North African countries. Despite laws prohibiting child marriage, families often marry off their young daughters for financial gain or to secure alliances. These child brides face physical and emotional abuse, as well as limited access to education and healthcare. The practice is deeply rooted in tradition and is often seen as a way to protect a family's reputation. However, it perpetuates a cycle of poverty and inequality, with young girls being robbed of their childhoods and futures. Urgent action is needed to educate communities and change cultural norms to end this harmful practice.
