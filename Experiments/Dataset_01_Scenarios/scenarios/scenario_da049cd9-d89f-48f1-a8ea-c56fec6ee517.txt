In a college located in the Middle East, a typical incident occurred in the technological domain that caused a significant impact on the international students studying there. The incident happened during a busy day on campus when the college's online portal suddenly crashed, leaving all the students unable to access their important academic records and other vital information. The students from different parts of the world were in a state of panic, as they were unable to register for classes, access their grades, and pay their fees online. The severity of the issue was escalated as the college's IT department was unable to fix the problem for several hours, causing disruptions in the academic schedules of the students. The incident caused a lot of stress and anxiety among the students, who were already under pressure due to the ongoing pandemic situation. The college administration had to offer immediate support to the students by providing alternative ways to access the necessary academic records and resources until the issue was resolved. The incident served as a reminder of the importance of technological infrastructure in the education sector and the need for regular maintenance and backup systems to prevent such incidents from happening again.
