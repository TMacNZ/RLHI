In the lush rainforests of South America, a dangerous environmental issue is threatening the chosen families that call it home. The issue at hand is the size of the forest itself, and the philosophical debate that surrounds it. On one hand, some argue that the forest should remain untouched, as its size and diversity are integral to the health of the ecosystem and the people who depend on it. On the other hand, others argue that the size of the forest is irrelevant if it cannot be sustainably managed and protected for future generations. As these debates rage on, the forest continues to shrink at an alarming rate due to deforestation, mining, and other exploitative practices. The chosen families who rely on the forest for their livelihoods and cultural traditions are facing displacement and loss of their way of life as a result. It is a complex and urgent issue that requires a thoughtful and collaborative approach to find a solution that balances the needs of the environment and the people who inhabit it.
