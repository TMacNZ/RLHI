It's a classic case of technological failure that has been causing annoyance between two colleagues in a small office located in the heart of Europe. One of the employees, let's call him John, has been experiencing constant connectivity issues with his computer. Every time he tries to access a file or send an email, his computer freezes, and he's forced to restart it. This problem has been going on for weeks, and John has been complaining to his colleague, Sarah, who sits right across from him. Sarah, on the other hand, has been trying to help John by offering him various solutions, but nothing seems to be working. This technological hiccup has been causing tension between the two, and they often find themselves bickering over the smallest things. It's becoming clear that unless this issue is resolved soon, it may escalate into a bigger problem that will affect not just their working relationship but also their productivity.
