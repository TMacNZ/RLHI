In the year 3021, a group of intergalactic philosophers had gathered in the Middle East to discuss the nature of existence. The debate had been going on for hours, with each philosopher fervently arguing their point of view. Suddenly, the discussion became heated, and a disagreement broke out between two of the most respected philosophers in the galaxy. The argument centered around the concept of "getting" - one philosopher believed that the only way to truly exist was to "get" as much as possible, while the other believed that the key to existence was in letting go of the desire to "get" anything. As the argument escalated, the other philosophers tried to intervene, but it was too late. The two scholars began to physically fight, causing chaos in the meeting room. Finally, security was called in to break up the altercation, but the damage had already been done. The once peaceful gathering of intellectuals had descended into a violent disagreement over the meaning of life itself.
