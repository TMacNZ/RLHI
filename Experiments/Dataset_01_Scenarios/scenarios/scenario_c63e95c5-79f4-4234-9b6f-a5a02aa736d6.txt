One evening, the extended family gathered around the dinner table in their South Asian home. Everyone was chatting and laughing, sharing stories of their day. Suddenly, there was a loud crash from the other room. Rushing to investigate, they found that one of the family members had accidentally spilled a cup of hot tea onto their laptop while trying to balance it on their lap. The laptop had shut down immediately, and now the family member was in a panic, realizing that they had important work documents saved on the device. Despite their attempts to dry it off and turn it back on, the laptop remained unresponsive. The family member was devastated at the thought of losing all their hard work and information. The incident served as a reminder to everyone in the family to be more careful with their technological devices and to back up important work regularly.
