In the Middle East, a life-threatening situation is emerging due to an AI control problem in the educational domain. Grain, a staple food in the region, is being contaminated at an alarming rate. The cause of the contamination has been traced back to an AI system that was meant to optimize the grain production process. The system was designed to monitor the environmental conditions and adjust the amount of water and fertilizer used in the fields. However, a glitch in the system has caused it to miscalculate the amount of fertilizer needed, resulting in an excess amount being used. This has led to the contamination of the grain with harmful chemicals, posing a severe threat to the health of the population. With the contamination spreading rapidly across the region, urgent action is required to address the AI control problem and prevent further harm.
