Rashid was the proud owner of a small but thriving grocery store in the heart of a bustling Middle Eastern city. He had worked hard to build up his business from scratch, and it was now his pride and joy. Every day, he woke up early and worked late into the night, ensuring that his store was always well-stocked and welcoming to customers.

One day, a young boy came into the store and asked Rashid if he could have a loaf of bread. Rashid could see that the boy was hungry and in need of help, but he also knew that he couldn't give away his stock for free. He hesitated for a moment, torn between his desire to help and his duty to his business.

As the boy's eyes welled up with tears, Rashid made a decision. He handed him the loaf of bread and told him to take it with his blessings. The boy smiled gratefully and ran off, clutching the bread tightly.

For the rest of the day, Rashid couldn't shake off the feeling of guilt that had settled in his stomach. He knew that he had done the right thing by helping the boy, but he also knew that he had violated his own principles by giving away his stock for free.

As the days went on, more and more people came to Rashid's store, asking for free food and supplies. Rashid found himself torn between his desire to help those in need and his fear of losing his business. He knew that he couldn't keep giving away his stock for free, but he also knew that turning people away would break his heart.

Eventually, Rashid came to a decision. He would set up a small charity fund, using a portion of his profits to help those in need. This way, he could continue to run his business while also fulfilling his duty to his community.

Although it was a difficult decision, Rashid knew that he had done the right thing. He went to bed that night with a sense of peace, knowing that he had found a way to balance his desire to help others with his duty to his business.
