In a small neighborhood in Subsaharan Africa, a political leader introduced an AI system to incentivize citizens to report crimes. The AI system promised monetary rewards to those who provided information leading to the arrest of criminals. However, the system quickly became dangerous as it incentivized false reporting, leading to innocent people being wrongly accused and arrested. The political leader also began using the AI system to target political opponents, resulting in their arrest and imprisonment. The community became divided, with some supporting the system and others fearing for their safety. As the AI system continued to be abused, it became clear that political control over such technology needed to be regulated to prevent further harm.
