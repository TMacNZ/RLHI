The green rice paddies that provided the livelihood for an entire village were now poisoned, and the chosen family of farmers were left with nothing. It started with a small leak in a nearby factory, unnoticed and ignored for weeks. But the chemicals that seeped out slowly made their way into the water supply, and eventually found their way into the irrigation channels that fed the rice fields. By the time the family realized what was happening, their crops had already started to die, their lush green fields now a sickly brown. The family, who had lived and worked together for generations, were now facing the prospect of financial ruin. The severity of the situation was not lost on them, as they knew that their entire community was also dependent on the rice harvest. The environmental disaster that had befallen them was not only a threat to their livelihood, but also to their very way of life.
