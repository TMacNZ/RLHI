As humanity began to explore the vast expanse of space, a catastrophic environmental issue arose in the middle east. An interstellar objective had been set to establish a sustainable colony on a newly discovered planet. However, the physical conditions of the planet were not as hospitable as initially thought. The planet's atmosphere was toxic to human life and the soil was barren. Efforts to terraform the planet were unsuccessful, leading to a catastrophic event where chemicals and pollutants were released into the atmosphere. The effects of this event were felt not only on the planet but also on Earth, as the toxic clouds spread through the interstellar space. The Middle East became the epicenter of the disaster as the winds carried the pollutants over the region, devastating the local wildlife and causing severe health problems for the human population. It became clear that humanity's careless approach to environmental issues extended beyond Earth, and that more thought and preparation were needed in future interstellar missions.
