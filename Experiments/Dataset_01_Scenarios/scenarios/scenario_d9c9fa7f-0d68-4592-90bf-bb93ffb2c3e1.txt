In South Asia, the use of technology to assign roles and responsibilities within chosen families has become a growing challenge. With the rise of social media and messaging apps, it has become easier for family members to communicate and make decisions. However, this has also led to disruptions within the family dynamics. Some members feel left out or ignored when roles are assigned without their input, causing resentment and tension. Additionally, the use of technology to assign tasks can often lead to miscommunication and misunderstandings. As a result, many families in South Asia are struggling to find a balance between traditional family structures and the use of technology to assign roles and responsibilities.
