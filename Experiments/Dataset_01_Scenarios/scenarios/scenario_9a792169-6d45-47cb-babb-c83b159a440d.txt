The fifth day of the annual North African conference was in full swing when an intense argument erupted between two prominent delegates. The disagreement began during a panel discussion on regional security, with one delegate accusing the other of neglecting their responsibilities in combating terrorism.

The argument quickly escalated, and the two delegates began to shout at each other, drawing the attention of the entire conference. The other delegates tried to intervene and defuse the situation, but the two men were too emotionally charged to listen to reason.

As tensions rose, one of the delegates suddenly lashed out physically, shoving the other to the ground. The room erupted in chaos as other delegates rushed to separate the two combatants.

The incident was highly disruptive, and the conference was suspended for the rest of the day as a result. The two delegates were escorted out of the building by security personnel and were subsequently banned from attending any future conferences.

The incident sent shockwaves throughout the North African region, with many people expressing their disappointment and disgust at the behavior of the two delegates. The organizers of the conference were forced to issue a public apology for the disruption caused and promised to take measures to ensure that such incidents would not happen in the future.

The argument between the two delegates served as a stark reminder of the challenges facing the region and the need for greater collaboration and cooperation in tackling issues such as terrorism.
