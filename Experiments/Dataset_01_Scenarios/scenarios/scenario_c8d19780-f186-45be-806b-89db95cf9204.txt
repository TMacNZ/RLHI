John and his wife Mary were on a road trip from New York to California. During their journey, they stopped at a small town in the Midwest to visit a church. As they walked around the church, they met a group of friendly locals who offered to accompany them on their tour. After a while, the group invited John and Mary to attend a traditional religious ceremony that was taking place that evening. Excited to experience something new, they accepted the invitation. However, during the ceremony, something went terribly wrong. A fire broke out, trapping most of the attendees inside the building. John and Mary managed to escape, but they were devastated by the loss of life. The incident left a lasting impact on them, causing them to question their beliefs and the role of religion in their lives.
