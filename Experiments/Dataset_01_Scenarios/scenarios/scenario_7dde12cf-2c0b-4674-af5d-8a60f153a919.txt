Throughout the summit, he made a conscious effort to engage with local leaders and representatives from various social groups. He asked thoughtful questions and listened attentively to their responses, gaining a deeper understanding of their perspectives. Although this challenge seemed insignificant in the grand scheme of things, the president recognized the importance of fostering relationships with other nations and cultures.
