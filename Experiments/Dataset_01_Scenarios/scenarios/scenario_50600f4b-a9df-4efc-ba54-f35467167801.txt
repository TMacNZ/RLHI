In Eurasia, a quick glance at the chosen family of a political leader reveals a concerning trend of health issues. While not severe enough to cause immediate alarm, the ordinary nature of these health concerns raises questions about the leader's ability to focus on their duties while also caring for their loved ones. The stress of politics can exacerbate health issues and potentially impact the leader's decision-making abilities. As such, it is important for the leader to prioritize not only their own health but also that of their chosen family, in order to ensure a stable and effective political leadership.
