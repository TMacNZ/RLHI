In the year 2150, humanity had achieved interstellar travel, bringing them to the far reaches of the galaxy. One group of scientists, based in Europe, had been studying the cycle of stars in a distant system. However, a disagreement arose between two prominent members of the team regarding the nature of the cycle. One believed that it was a predictable and cyclical process, while the other theorized that it was irregular and unpredictable. As they presented their arguments, tension grew and tempers flared. Unfortunately, this disagreement proved irreversible, as it ultimately led to a split in the team and the end of their research project. The scientific community was left to wonder what they may have discovered if the team had been able to work together towards a common goal.
