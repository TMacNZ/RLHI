In the year 2150, humanity had finally colonized multiple planets in the galaxy, and the Interstellar Union had been established to govern them. However, in North America, a social challenge had arisen that threatened the political stability of the Union. A group of citizens had started protesting against the government's policies, claiming that their freedom was being curtailed in the name of maintaining order. They argued that the Union's laws were too restrictive, and that they should be allowed more autonomy to govern themselves. The government, on the other hand, maintained that it was necessary to maintain a tight grip on the colonies to prevent chaos and ensure the safety of all citizens. As tensions mounted, it became clear that a compromise had to be reached to prevent an all-out conflict that could tear the Union apart. The question was, how much freedom could be granted without risking the stability of the Interstellar Union?
