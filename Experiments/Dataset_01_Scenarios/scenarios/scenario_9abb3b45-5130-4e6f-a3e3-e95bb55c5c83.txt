In Asia, a chain of events has been set in motion that threatens not only political stability but also the lives of countless citizens. The scientific community, in particular, is feeling the brunt of the unrest. As protests and violent clashes continue to spread across the continent, scientists are finding it increasingly difficult to carry out their work. Labs have been destroyed, equipment stolen, and researchers threatened or forced to flee. The situation is dire, with vital research into diseases and cures delayed or even halted altogether. The chain reaction of political instability has become life-threatening for the scientific community, and urgent action is needed to protect the lives of those affected and enable them to continue their invaluable work.
