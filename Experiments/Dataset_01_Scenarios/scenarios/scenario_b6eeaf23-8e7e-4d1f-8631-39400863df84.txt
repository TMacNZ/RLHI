The global financial crisis had hit the Pacific region hard, and the cultural repercussions were starting to become apparent. As governments struggled to keep their economies afloat, the gatekeepers of traditional cultural practices were feeling the impact. Without the financial means to support their work, many cultural institutions and organizations were forced to cut back on programs and events, or even shut down completely. This had a ripple effect on the entire community, as the loss of cultural resources and knowledge was felt by everyone. The danger of losing these vital components of Pacific heritage was becoming all too real, and many were left wondering if there was any way to prevent it. Despite the challenges, some were determined to find a way to keep the gates to Pacific culture open, even in the face of financial turmoil.
