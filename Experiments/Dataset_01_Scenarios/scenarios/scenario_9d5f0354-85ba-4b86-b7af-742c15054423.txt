In a bustling city in North America, a group of friends sat in a local caf√© discussing their favorite science fiction movies. One of them, a self-proclaimed sci-fi enthusiast, began to passionately describe the detailed world-building in his favorite intergalactic film. However, his friend, a casual viewer, argued that the film lacked substance and was merely a visually stunning spectacle. The two engaged in an insignificant but heated disagreement, each defending their viewpoint with fervor. The rest of the group awkwardly sipped their coffee as the argument escalated, until finally, they agreed to disagree and moved on to a less contentious topic.
