In the year 2235, a group of interstellar explorers from Earth made first contact with a highly advanced alien civilization in the European sector of the galaxy. The aliens, who identified themselves as the Holy Ones, possessed knowledge and technology far beyond anything humans had ever seen. However, their beliefs and customs were vastly different from those of Earth's inhabitants. The Holy Ones believed that all intelligent life was created by a divine force, and that their purpose was to spread this belief throughout the galaxy. This posed a significant social challenge for the humans, as many of them held different religious beliefs or were atheists. The intellectual domain was also affected, as the Holy Ones' knowledge and technology sparked debates and discussions among scientists and scholars. The long-lasting impact of this encounter would shape the future of interstellar relations for years to come.
