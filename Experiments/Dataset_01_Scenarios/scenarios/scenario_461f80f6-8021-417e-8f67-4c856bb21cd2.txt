Sarah had always struggled with anxiety, but it had gotten worse since the pandemic began. She found herself constantly worrying about her health, her job, and her relationships. She tried all the usual coping strategies - exercise, meditation, talking to friends - but nothing seemed to help. One day, while on a video call with her chosen family, Sarah had a panic attack. She couldn't catch her breath and felt like she was suffocating. Her chosen family quickly recognized what was happening and reminded her to breathe deeply and slowly. They talked her through the panic attack, reminding her that they were there for her and that she was not alone. After the call, Sarah felt relieved and grateful for the support of her chosen family. She realized that even though they were not blood relatives, they were still a vital part of her support system and could help her through even the toughest of times.
