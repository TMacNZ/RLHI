In the remote villages of Subsaharan Africa, a young man was on a mission to find his missing sister. She had gone out to gather firewood and never returned. The village had organized a search party, but they had no luck. The young man knew that time was running out, and he needed to find her quickly. The problem was that the dense forest was vast, and searching by foot would take days. The villagers had no technology to aid them in their search, and the young man was desperate. The technological failure in this region was a philosophical issue that questioned the value of human life. The young man knew that if he didn't find his sister soon, she may not survive. He decided to take matters into his own hands and used the little knowledge he had of technology to create a makeshift drone. With trembling hands, he set it off into the forest, hoping it would help him locate his sister. The drone flew over the treetops and spotted a small clearing. The young man ran towards it and found his sister lying unconscious. She had fallen and hit her head, and without immediate medical attention, she would have died. The young man carried his sister back to the village, where the villagers were amazed at what he had done. They had never seen anything like it before. The young man's determination and will to save his sister's life had led him to create a technological solution that had saved her life.
