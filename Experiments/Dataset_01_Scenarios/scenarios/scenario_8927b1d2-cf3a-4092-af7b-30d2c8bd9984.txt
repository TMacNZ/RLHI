In Asia, a scientific study has predicted a long-lasting financial crisis due to the high number of mortgage defaults across the continent. The study shows that many families have taken out mortgages they cannot afford, leading to a wave of defaults that will affect the entire region. The severity of the crisis is expected to be significant, with many families losing their homes and facing financial ruin. The study recommends that governments take action to regulate mortgage lending and prevent further defaults. The impact of this crisis on the continent's economy and society is likely to be extensive, and it will take years to recover from the damage caused by the mortgage crisis.
