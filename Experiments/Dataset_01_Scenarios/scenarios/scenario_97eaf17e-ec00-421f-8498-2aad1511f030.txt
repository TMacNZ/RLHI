In Subsaharan Africa, a growing number of online businesses are facing a disruptive ethical dilemma. Although they have sufficient resources to expand their reach and increase their profits, they are struggling to navigate cultural differences that impact their business practices. For example, some businesses are using aggressive marketing tactics that are considered intrusive or disrespectful in certain communities. Others are selling products that are controversial or offensive to local customs and beliefs. As a result, these businesses are facing backlash from both customers and the broader community. To succeed in this market, online businesses must strike a delicate balance between their own goals and values and the cultural norms and expectations of the people they serve.
