In the year 2350, tensions between Earth and the Intergalactic Federation had reached an all-time high. The North American region was the epicenter of political unrest, with protests and strikes popping up in major cities. The physical domain was also affected as cargo ships were being held up at the ports, causing a ripple effect in the global economy. The severity of the situation reached a critical point when an Intergalactic Federation ship was attacked by unknown assailants while passing through North American airspace. The ship sustained heavy damage and many lives were lost, worsening the already strained relationship between Earth and the Federation. As investigations began, rumors circulated that the attack may have been orchestrated by a rogue political group within North America. The situation was dire and the world held its breath as tensions continued to escalate.
