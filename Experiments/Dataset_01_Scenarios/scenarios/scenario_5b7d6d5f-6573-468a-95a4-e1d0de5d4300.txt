Dr. Rebecca Chen was a renowned expert in the field of biotechnology. She had been invited to Eurasia to speak at a scientific conference on the latest advances in genetic engineering. As she made her way to the conference center, she noticed a group of protestors gathered outside. They were holding signs and shouting slogans, demanding that the conference be cancelled. Dr. Chen tried to ignore them and continued walking, but suddenly, she felt a sharp pain in her back. She turned around to see one of the protestors had thrown a rock at her. The situation quickly escalated as the group began throwing more rocks and physically attacking anyone who tried to enter the conference center. Dr. Chen was left with no choice but to retreat to her hotel room, shaken and terrified by the catastrophic level of violence she had witnessed. She couldn't help but wonder how this conflict between the scientific community and those who opposed their work had reached such a dangerous point.
