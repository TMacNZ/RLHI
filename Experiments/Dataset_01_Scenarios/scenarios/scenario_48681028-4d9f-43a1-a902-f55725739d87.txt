It was a typical bustling day in the city. People hurried through the streets, cars honked, and the sun beat down on the pavement. But for one man, this day would be anything but typical. 

John, a lawyer, had just left his office building and was on his way to meet a client. He was lost in thought, going over his notes when suddenly, he felt a sharp pain in his side. He stumbled but managed to keep his balance. Turning around, he saw a man with a knife, demanding his wallet. 

John knew he had to act fast. He quickly handed over his wallet, hoping that would be the end of it. But the assailant wasn't satisfied. He lunged at John again, this time aiming for his throat. 

In a split second decision, John grabbed the man's arm and twisted it behind him, causing the knife to fall to the ground. The attacker struggled, but John managed to pin him down until the police arrived. 

It was later revealed that the man had been involved in multiple incidents in the past, and thanks to John's quick thinking, he was finally caught and brought to justice. 

The encounter left John shaken, but he knew that he had done the right thing. He was hailed as a hero by his colleagues and the community, and even received an award from the police department for his bravery. From that day on, John never took his safety for granted and always remained vigilant on the streets of the city.
