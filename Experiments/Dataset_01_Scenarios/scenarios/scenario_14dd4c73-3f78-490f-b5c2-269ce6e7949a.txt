The legal department of a global corporation in Eurasia is facing a mundane issue related to personnel. The issue is not severe and does not pose a threat to the company's operations, but it still requires attention. One of the legal team members is going on a long vacation, and the department needs to come up with a plan to cover their workload while they are away. The team leader is considering hiring a temporary replacement but is unsure about the logistics and costs of doing so. They are also worried about how the temporary personnel will fit in with the team dynamics, as they will only be working for a short period. Despite the seemingly insignificant nature of the issue, the legal team is determined to find a solution that will maintain the department's efficiency and effectiveness, even with a team member out of the office.
