Within minutes, the wind had turned violent, and the house started to shake. The chosen family rushed to the windows to see what was happening outside. They saw that a small tornado had formed and was heading straight for their home. The family quickly sprang into action, grabbing anything they could to reinforce the windows and doors. The tornado hit their house with full force, causing some minor damage to the roof and windows. But thanks to their quick thinking, Jaya and her chosen family were able to stay safe and ride out the natural disaster. As the winds died down, they all breathed a sigh of relief and were grateful for each other's company and support during this scary moment.
