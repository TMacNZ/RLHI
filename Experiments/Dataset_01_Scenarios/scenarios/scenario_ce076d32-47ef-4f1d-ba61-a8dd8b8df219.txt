Growing up in the Middle East, I never thought that the word "nuclear" would become part of my daily vocabulary. However, with the rise of political tensions and the threat of violence, I have been forced to face the long-lasting effects of technological conflict. As a young adult, I fear for the safety of my family and friends, knowing that one mistake or miscalculation could result in a catastrophic event. The constant rumors of nuclear weapons being developed and the possibility of an attack make it difficult to live a normal life. Every day, I pray for peace and wish that the leaders of our region would focus on finding common ground instead of using technology as a means of destruction. Despite the challenges, I remain hopeful that one day, we will overcome this conflict and usher in a new era of peace and prosperity.
