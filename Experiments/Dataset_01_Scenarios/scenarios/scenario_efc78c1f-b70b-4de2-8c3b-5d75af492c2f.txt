In the heart of North Africa, a disagreement over religious beliefs has caused a rift between two major unions. One union is comprised of those who follow the traditional practices of their faith, while the other union advocates for a more modern interpretation. As tensions rise, both sides have dug their heels in deeper, unwilling to compromise. The disagreement has spilled out into the streets, with each union holding their own rallies and protests. The situation has become so severe that it has caught the attention of neighboring countries, as well as spiritual leaders from around the world. Despite attempts at mediation, the two unions remain at odds, with no resolution in sight. The divide between the unions threatens to fracture the continent, as other nations take sides and tensions continue to escalate.
