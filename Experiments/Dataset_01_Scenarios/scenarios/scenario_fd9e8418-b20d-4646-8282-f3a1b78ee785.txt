In the year 2156, humanity had finally achieved interstellar travel, thanks to the development of necessary technologies that allowed humans to travel beyond their own planet. However, this newfound power came with a terrible cost. A group of radical technologists had developed a weapon that could irreversibly alter the very fabric of space and time, and they had set their sights on South America, a region that had long been a hotbed of conflict and violence. The weapon was deployed, and in an instant, the skies over South America were ripped apart, opening a gaping hole in the fabric of the universe. The damage was irreversible, and the effects were felt across the entire planet. Crops failed, the climate shifted, and the very nature of reality itself was forever changed. The surviving nations of the world banded together to try and repair the damage, but it was too late. The necessary technologies that had once been a source of hope and progress had become a tool of destruction, and humanity was left to grapple with the terrible consequences of their actions.
