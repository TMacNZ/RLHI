The wooden furniture industry in North Africa is facing a critical environmental issue due to the increasing demand for online shopping. With more people opting to purchase wooden furniture online, there has been a significant rise in the amount of wood being cut down to meet the demand. This has resulted in deforestation, which not only harms the environment but also has economic consequences. The loss of trees means that the region's timber industry is at risk, which could lead to job losses and a decline in the economy. It's essential for the government and industry leaders to take action to prevent further damage to the environment and find sustainable solutions for the wooden furniture industry.
