The year was 2085, and human colonies had spread far beyond the reaches of Earth. One such colony was located on a distant planet in the South American sector of the galaxy. The colony had been established for over a decade, and the inhabitants were a tight-knit community. However, tensions began to rise when a group of colonists discovered a new technological breakthrough that allowed them to manipulate a person's sexual desires and impulses. They began to experiment on one another, using the technology to enhance their own pleasure and experiences.

At first, the experiments were harmless and consensual, but as time went on, some colonists began to use the technology to control and manipulate others. What started as a simple enhancement of sexual pleasure turned into a dangerous tool for coercion and abuse. The situation came to a head when a group of colonists who had been victimized by the technology decided to take matters into their own hands.

Violence erupted as the victims sought revenge against their abusers, leading to a full-blown conflict within the colony. The situation became even more complicated when the authorities from Earth intervened, attempting to quell the violence and bring the situation under control.

The sexual technology was eventually banned and destroyed, but the damage had already been done. The once tight-knit community was torn apart by conflict and violence, leaving scars that would never fully heal. The incident served as a stark reminder of the dangers of technology and the importance of responsible use.
