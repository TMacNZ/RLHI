As soon as she saw the message, her heart sank. Her ex-boyfriend had moved on and was now in a happy relationship with someone else. She had been scrolling through her social media feed when she stumbled upon a picture of the two of them, smiling and holding hands. It was like a chain reaction of emotions. First, disbelief. Then, sadness. Followed by anger. And finally, resignation. She couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy as she clicked through their photos, wondering what she had done wrong. She knew deep down that she needed to let go and move on, but it was easier said than done. The irreversible reality of the situation weighed heavily on her, and she couldn't shake the feeling of emptiness that had settled in the pit of her stomach. She took a deep breath and closed her laptop, knowing that it was time to focus on her own life and break the chain of negative emotions that had been holding her back.
