In North Africa, a technological failure has caused a typical interpersonal problem with severe consequences. Due to a glitch in the government's wage system, thousands of workers have not received their pay for several months. This has resulted in protests and strikes, causing a political crisis. The government officials are unable to resolve the issue as the technology used to process wages is outdated and needs a major overhaul. As a result, workers are losing faith in their government, and the already unstable political situation is worsening. The situation requires immediate intervention from experts to upgrade the system and restore the trust of the people in the government's ability to manage their finances effectively.
