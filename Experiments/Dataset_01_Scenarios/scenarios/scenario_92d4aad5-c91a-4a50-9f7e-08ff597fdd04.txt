As humanity explored the depths of space, they encountered new civilizations and cultures. One such encounter was with a society of intelligent beings on a distant planet. The humans were excited to pitch their ideas and technology to these beings, hoping to establish a mutually beneficial relationship. However, as they landed on the planet, they were shocked to find that the beings were enslaved by a powerful group of interstellar conquerors. The humans were faced with a serious moral dilemma: how could they establish a relationship with a society that was oppressed and in need of liberation? They knew that they couldn't simply impose their own values and beliefs on the alien culture, but they also couldn't stand by and watch as an entire civilization was held captive. As they grappled with this complex social challenge, they turned to their own experiences with oppression and liberation, drawing from the struggles of subsaharan Africa, to find a solution that respected the agency and autonomy of the alien society while also working towards their freedom.
