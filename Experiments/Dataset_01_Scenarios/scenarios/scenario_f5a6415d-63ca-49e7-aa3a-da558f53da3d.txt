Tension had been simmering for months in the extended family, but it wasn't until the catastrophic nerve gas attack that everything boiled over. The family, scattered across the Pacific region, had always had differing political views, but the economic fallout from the attack had driven a wedge between them that seemed impossible to mend. Some argued that the attack was a result of political unrest in the region, while others believed it was part of a larger economic conspiracy. Either way, the family was divided, and tensions were high. As they struggled to come to terms with the tragedy, some members of the family found themselves at odds with each other, unable to reconcile their differences in the face of such a devastating event.
