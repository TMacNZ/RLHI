In a small village in South Asia, a group of children were playing near the village pool. The pool, which was used for irrigation purposes, was not meant for swimming, but the children often used it as their own personal swimming hole. One day, while the children were playing, a sudden storm rolled in, causing the water level in the pool to rise rapidly. The children, caught off guard, struggled to swim to the edge of the pool as the water continued to rise. The situation quickly turned life-threatening as the children began to tire and some even started to panic. Without any lifeguards or adults present, the children were left to fend for themselves. However, one of the older children remembered a lesson from their school's science class about water displacement and was able to use that knowledge to create makeshift flotation devices out of nearby objects to help the other children stay afloat until the storm passed. Thanks to the quick thinking and intellectual problem-solving of the older child, all of the children were eventually able to make it safely to the edge of the pool.
