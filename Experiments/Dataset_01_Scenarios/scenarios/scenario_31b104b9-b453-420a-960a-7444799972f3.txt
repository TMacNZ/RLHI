In the small coastal town of Pacific, the extended family of the Johnsons were facing a long-lasting financial crisis due to an unexpected environmental disaster. The town's main source of income was fishing, but the recent oil spill had severely affected the marine life, leaving the fishermen with empty nets. The Johnsons, who owned a small fishing business, were struggling to make ends meet. To make matters worse, one of the family members had developed a severe allergy to latex gloves, which they needed to wear while handling the fish. This meant that they had to purchase expensive non-latex gloves, putting an additional strain on their already tight budget. The family was feeling the pressure of the situation, unsure of how they were going to survive the coming months. They had always been close-knit, but this crisis was testing their bonds like never before.
