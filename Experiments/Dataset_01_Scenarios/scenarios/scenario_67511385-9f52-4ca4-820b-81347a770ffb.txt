In a remote village in Europe, a group of scientists discovered a dangerous cosmic album that had crash-landed on Earth. This album emitted powerful waves that disrupted the physical health of anyone within a hundred-mile radius. The villagers, unaware of the danger, began to experience strange symptoms ranging from headaches and nausea to more severe conditions like seizures and respiratory distress. The scientists immediately set up a quarantine zone to prevent further spread of the album's effects, but they knew they needed to act fast to find a way to neutralize the album's harmful waves before the entire continent was affected. As they worked tirelessly in their lab, the rest of Europe watched in fear, hoping for a solution before it was too late.
