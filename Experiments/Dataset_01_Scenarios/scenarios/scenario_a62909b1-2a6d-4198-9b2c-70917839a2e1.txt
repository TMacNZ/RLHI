Math has become a political issue in Eurasia, causing a divide among chosen families in the region. The government has implemented a new math curriculum that many parents believe is too rigorous and not age-appropriate for their children. The controversy has led to heated discussions and debates among family members, with some arguing that the new curriculum will give their children an advantage in the global economy, while others worry that the pressure to excel in math will harm their children's mental health and wellbeing. The divide has become so long-lasting that it has led to fractured relationships within chosen families, with some members feeling ostracized for their stance on the issue. Despite the government's attempts to address the concerns of parents, the math curriculum remains a contentious topic, highlighting the challenges of navigating social and political issues within the context of chosen families.
