The small village of Qarun in the Middle East was bustling with activity as its residents prepared for the annual religious festival. The celebration would last for three days and included a grand feast where everyone would gather together to share food and stories.

As the festivities began, the villagers gathered around a large table that was set up in the center of the village square. The table was adorned with colorful decorations and filled to the brim with delicious food.

However, as the night wore on, something strange began to happen. One by one, the villagers who had eaten from the table began to fall ill. At first, it was just a few cases of upset stomachs, but soon the situation spiraled out of control.

The severity of the situation became apparent when the entire village was struck with a catastrophic outbreak of an unknown disease. People were collapsing left and right, their bodies wracked with fever and convulsions.

The local healers were at a loss about what caused the outbreak, and they turned to the spiritual leaders of the village for help. They believed that the disease was a result of a curse that had been placed on the table by an evil spirit.

The villagers gathered together and prayed for deliverance from the curse. They brought in holy men and women from nearby towns to perform a spiritual cleansing ceremony to rid the table of any evil spirits.

In the end, the ceremony seemed to work. The villagers who had fallen ill began to recover, and the outbreak was eventually contained. The incident left a lasting impression on the village, and the table was never used again for the annual festival. Instead, the villagers decided to hold their feast outdoors, under the stars, where they felt closer to their spiritual beliefs and had a sense of protection from any unknown forces.
