Actually, an ethical dilemma has arisen in the Middle East regarding the use of online platforms for life-threatening situations. With the rise of social media and messaging apps, individuals in need of emergency medical attention have been turning to these platforms for help. While this has led to some successful interventions, it also raises questions about the responsibility of online users and platforms in providing aid. Should individuals be legally obligated to assist those in need, even if they are strangers online? Should social media companies be held accountable for not implementing measures to ensure that emergency situations are quickly addressed? These philosophical debates have real-world implications for the safety and well-being of individuals in the Middle East who rely on online platforms for help.
