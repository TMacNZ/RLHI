In the year 2150, the capital planet of the Interstellar Council was located in North America. It was the heart of the organization, where all the important decisions were made. However, a catastrophic event occurred that shook the foundations of the council. A group of rebels had infiltrated the capital and caused a massive explosion that destroyed most of the buildings and infrastructure. The political unrest that followed was unprecedented, with many members accusing each other of being involved or not doing enough to prevent it. The legal system was overwhelmed with lawsuits and trials, with many of the accused being sentenced to life in prison or worse. The Interstellar Council was left in disarray, with many members calling for a change in leadership and a complete overhaul of the security protocols. It was a dark time for the capital and the entire organization, but they knew they had to find a way to move forward and rebuild.
