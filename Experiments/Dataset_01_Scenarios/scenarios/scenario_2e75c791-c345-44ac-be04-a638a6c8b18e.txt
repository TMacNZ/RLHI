In North Africa, the egg has become a symbol of the financial crisis that has hit the region hard. With the rising cost of living, many individuals are struggling to afford basic necessities, including food. Eggs, once a staple in many households, have become a luxury item that only the wealthy can afford. This has led to a social divide, with those who can't afford eggs feeling left behind and isolated from their communities. For some, the inability to provide eggs for their families has become a critical issue, leading to financial stress and even desperation. The egg crisis has highlighted the social and economic inequalities that exist in the region and has become a rallying cry for change.
