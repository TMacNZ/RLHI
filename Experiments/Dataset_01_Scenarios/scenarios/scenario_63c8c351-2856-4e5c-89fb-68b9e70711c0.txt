As Sarah sat down for breakfast, she turned on the TV to catch up on the latest news. What she saw made her heart sink. The South Pacific was bracing itself for a massive tropical storm, set to hit the region in just a few days. Sarah had always lived in the South Pacific and had experienced her share of typhoons, but something about this news seemed different. As a scientist, she knew that the warming oceans were leading to more frequent and severe storms. She could feel the disruption in her own life already. She had plans to travel for work next week, but now she wasn't sure if she'd be able to leave. She had to start thinking about preparing her home and stocking up on supplies. The news had hit her hard, and she knew that she wasn't the only one feeling the weight of this impending disaster.
