In the remote South Pacific island nation of Tava'i, a devastating financial crisis has left many individuals struggling to make ends meet. One such individual is a young philosopher named Lani, who has been unable to secure a stable job or source of income. With mounting debt and no clear way out, Lani's life has become a patchwork of odd jobs and short-term opportunities that barely keep her afloat. To make matters worse, Lani's philosophical musings on the nature of existence and the role of money in society have left her feeling increasingly isolated from those around her. As the severity of the crisis deepens, Lani finds herself facing a life-threatening situation, with no clear solution in sight. Faced with the harsh reality of her situation, Lani must confront her philosophical beliefs and consider the practical steps she can take to survive in a world that places little value on her philosophical insights.
