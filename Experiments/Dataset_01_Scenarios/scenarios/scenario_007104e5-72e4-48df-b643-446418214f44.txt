In a remote village nestled deep in the heart of the Amazon rainforest in South America, an inquiry into a life-threatening situation has sparked a heated disagreement between two neighboring tribes. The severity of the situation cannot be ignored as a mysterious illness has been spreading rapidly, claiming the lives of many. The first tribe, known for their traditional medicinal practices, believe that the illness is caused by a curse from a neighboring tribe who they have had a long-standing emotional dispute with. However, the second tribe, who have been accused of the curse, vehemently deny the allegations and instead believe that the illness is a result of contaminated water from a nearby river. As tensions rise and emotions run high, it is unclear how this disagreement will be resolved and if a solution will be found before more lives are lost.
