In Subsaharan Africa, there has been a growing concern over the emotional well-being of young people due to the strict cultural control exercised over them. This control manifests in various ways, such as strict gender roles and expectations, arranged marriages, and limited educational opportunities. The severity of this social challenge is irreversible as it leads to generations of young people who are unable to fully express themselves, explore their potential, and make meaningful contributions to society. The impact of this emotional suppression is felt at a regional and statewide level as it affects the development of entire communities. The lack of control over their lives and future leaves young people feeling trapped and hopeless, leading to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. Addressing this challenge will require a multifaceted approach that involves empowering young people through education, promoting gender equality, and challenging harmful cultural practices. Only then can we hope to create a society where young people can thrive emotionally and contribute fully to their communities.
