The nuclear family living in the Pacific region was hit by a natural disaster - a strong earthquake that shattered everything in its wake. The family was in a state of shock and despair as they tried to pick up the pieces of their broken home. As the family gathered around to assess the damage, they realized that their coffee machine had been destroyed in the quake. This was a harsh reality for the family, as coffee had been an integral part of their daily routine. They relied on it to start their day, to keep them going during work, and to unwind in the evenings. The loss of their coffee machine felt like a blow to their intellectual well-being, leaving them feeling frustrated and helpless. Despite the ordinary severity of the situation, the family knew that they would have to adapt to this new reality without their beloved coffee, and find other ways to cope with the aftermath of the disaster.
