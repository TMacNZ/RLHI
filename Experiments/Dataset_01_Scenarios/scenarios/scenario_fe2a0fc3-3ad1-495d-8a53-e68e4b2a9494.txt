Jenny had recently moved to Asia for work and had been struggling to adjust to her new life. She was constantly feeling homesick and isolated, which had led her to seek solace in her faith. However, attending religious services had proven to be a challenge, as she had been unable to find a place of worship that felt right to her. After weeks of searching, Jenny finally found a small church that she felt comfortable attending, but there was one problem: it was located right next to a prison. Every time she went to the church, she had to pass by the high walls and barbed wire of the prison, which made her feel uneasy and distracted during the service. She tried to ignore it, but the sight of the prison kept nagging at her, making it difficult for her to fully engage in her spiritual practice. It was a small annoyance, but one that was starting to wear on her.
