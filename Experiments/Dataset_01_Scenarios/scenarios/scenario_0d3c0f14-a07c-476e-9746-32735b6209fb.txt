In Subsaharan Africa, an ancient philosophical debate has resurfaced in the wake of a critical technological failure. The question at hand: is it better to rely on old, proven technologies or embrace new, innovative ones? The incident in question involved a power outage that lasted for days, leaving entire communities without access to electricity. The cause of the outage was traced back to a faulty piece of equipment in a newly built power plant, which was touted as a symbol of progress and modernity. As the outage dragged on, some began to question the wisdom of abandoning traditional methods of generating power, such as biomass and hydroelectricity, in favor of untested technologies. Others argued that progress requires taking risks and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. The debate rages on, with no clear answer in sight.
