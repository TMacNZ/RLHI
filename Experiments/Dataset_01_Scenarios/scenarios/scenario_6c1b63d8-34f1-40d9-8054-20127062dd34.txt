The sudden disappearance of a large portion of the universe's dark matter, which constitutes the majority of the universe's mass, has triggered a dangerous financial crisis in Subsaharan Africa. The physical consequences of this event have been catastrophic, with planets and stars being ripped apart due to the loss of gravitational pull. The region has been hit particularly hard as the sudden loss of mass has destabilized the delicate balance of the Earth's orbit, causing massive earthquakes and tsunamis. The financial crisis has resulted from the collapse of intergalactic trade, as the value of precious metals and minerals has skyrocketed due to their scarcity. Governments and corporations are scrambling to find solutions, with some turning to extreme measures such as asteroid mining and black hole research to try and restore the lost mass. Meanwhile, the people of Subsaharan Africa are left to deal with the devastating physical and economic consequences of this cosmic catastrophe.
