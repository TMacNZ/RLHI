In a distant future where intergalactic travel was commonplace, a catastrophic failure in communication technology caused havoc in the Subsaharan Africa region. The failure was so severe that it threatened the lives of millions of people who relied on intergalactic communication for their daily needs. Panic and chaos ensued as people struggled to cope with the sudden loss of contact with the rest of the galaxy.

The once-thriving communities of Subsaharan Africa were now isolated and vulnerable, and the danger of this technological failure loomed large over their future.
