They were forced to compare their options for survival as they witnessed bombs exploding nearby and gunfire echoing in the streets. The family knew they had to act fast to protect themselves and their children. The father quickly gathered whatever supplies and resources they had and started barricading their home. The mother tended to the children, trying to keep them calm and distract them from the chaos outside. As the situation worsened, they realized they might need to flee their home and seek refuge elsewhere. They began comparing their options for escape, weighing the risks of staying versus the dangers of leaving. With heavy hearts, they ultimately decided to make a run for it, hoping to find safety in a nearby shelter. The family huddled together and braved the perilous journey, dodging debris and gunfire along the way. They finally made it to the shelter, exhausted and traumatized, but relieved to have made it out alive.
