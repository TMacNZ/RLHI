The direct and irreversible health concern affecting individuals in South Asia is the economic burden of chronic diseases. With rising rates of diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, individuals are struggling to afford the necessary medical treatments and medications to manage their conditions. This economic burden is not only affecting the individuals but also their families and communities. With limited access to healthcare and high medical costs, many are forced to choose between their health and their livelihoods. This vicious cycle of economic strain and chronic disease is perpetuating poverty and hindering progress in South Asia.
