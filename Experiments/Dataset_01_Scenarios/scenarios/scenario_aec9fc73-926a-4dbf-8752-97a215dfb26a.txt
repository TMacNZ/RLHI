It was a dark and stormy night in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. Maria had been living in the small village her whole life, and had never experienced a storm like this before. The wind was howling and the rain was pouring down in sheets. Suddenly, there was a deafening crack of thunder and a bolt of lightning struck a nearby tree causing it to split in half. Maria's home began to flood as the rain continued to pour down relentlessly. She knew that she had to act fast to save her family and their belongings. She scrambled to move their possessions to the highest points in their home, but it was no use. The water was rising too quickly. Maria gathered her family and ran for higher ground, hoping they could find shelter from the storm. As they trudged through the flooded village, they saw homes and buildings destroyed by the powerful storm. Maria knew it would take a long time for her village to recover from this natural disaster, but she was grateful to have her family by her side.
