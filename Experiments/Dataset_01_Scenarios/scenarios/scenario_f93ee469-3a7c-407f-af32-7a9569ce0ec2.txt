Since the beginning of the 21st century, North Africa has been facing a dangerous environmental issue that has affected the social and economic well-being of the region. Climate change has caused a significant rise in temperatures, leading to prolonged droughts and water scarcity in the area. This has resulted in a severe impact on agriculture, with crops failing and livestock dying off, leaving many families without sustenance. Furthermore, the lack of water has led to conflicts between different tribes and communities, with some resorting to violence to secure access to the precious resource. The situation has also resulted in a mass migration of people from rural areas to cities, putting a strain on already overburdened urban infrastructure. The international community has recognized the severity of the issue and has been working to provide aid to the affected regions, but much more needs to be done to address the root causes of the problem and prevent its escalation.
