In South Asia, the fashion industry's impact on the environment has caused long-lasting consequences for chosen families. With the rise of fast fashion and technological advancements, clothing production has become more accessible and affordable. However, the consequences of this convenience have been detrimental to the environment. The textile industry is one of the largest contributors to pollution, with water and air contamination caused by the use of harmful chemicals and dyes. This pollution has affected the health of those living in nearby communities, including chosen families. The severity of this issue has caused long-term health problems, such as respiratory issues and skin disorders. The technological advancements in the industry have also led to an increase in waste, as clothing is now designed to be disposable. The impact of the fashion industry on the environment has been devastating for chosen families in South Asia, and urgent action is needed to mitigate these effects.
