In North America, a dangerous ethical dilemma has arisen in the political domain regarding a target in the cosmic or universal scope. A group of powerful politicians have discovered a way to harness the energy of a distant star, which has the potential to provide unlimited power to the entire world. However, this energy extraction process is not only dangerous but also unethical as it could lead to the destruction of the star and its surrounding planets. The politicians are torn between their desire to provide cheap and abundant energy to their constituents and the moral implications of destroying an entire solar system. As the debate rages on, protests erupt across the continent, with environmentalists and concerned citizens calling for the project to be halted. The fate of the star and its surrounding planets lies in the hands of these politicians, who must decide whether to prioritize the needs of their people or the wellbeing of the universe.
