As the earthquake hit, Ali knew he had to act fast if he wanted to stay alive. The shaking ground beneath his feet was unlike anything he had ever experienced before. He could hear the screams of his neighbors and the sound of buildings crumbling around him. Ali's first instinct was to run outside, but as he opened the door to his apartment, he saw the destruction that lay before him. The streets were chaos, with people running in every direction and debris scattered everywhere. Ali knew he had to think quickly. He remembered reading about earthquake safety in school, and he knew that he needed to find cover. He ran back into his apartment and dove under his desk, bracing himself for the worst. As the shaking continued, it felt like the world was falling apart around him. But Ali held on, his mind racing with thoughts of survival. When the quake finally subsided, he emerged unscathed, but his city lay in ruins. Ali knew that it would take time to recover from the catastrophic disaster, but he also knew that he was lucky to be alive.
