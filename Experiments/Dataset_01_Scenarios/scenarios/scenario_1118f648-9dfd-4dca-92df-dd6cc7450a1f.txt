As a philosophy student in the Middle East, I came across a broad range of ideas and perspectives online. One day, while browsing a forum, I stumbled upon a heated debate about the nature of truth. Some argued that truth is objective and universal, while others claimed it to be relative and subjective. As the discussion grew more intense, one user accidentally posted a link to a completely unrelated website, causing a momentary disruption in the thread. Despite the insignificant nature of this accident, it sparked a philosophical reflection on the fragility of our online interactions and the potential for misunderstandings to arise even in the midst of a seemingly rational debate. It highlighted the need for us to approach online discussions with humility and an openness to learn from others, rather than to simply assert our own opinions.
