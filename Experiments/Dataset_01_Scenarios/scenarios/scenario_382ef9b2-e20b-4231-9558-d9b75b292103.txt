Living in the South Pacific, I have always been accustomed to the salty air and ocean breeze. However, over the years, I have noticed a widely concerning trend that has affected my health. The environment has changed drastically, and with it, my personal health concerns have evolved too. The air quality has deteriorated, and I have been experiencing persistent respiratory issues. The water has become contaminated, and I have fallen ill from consuming it. These long-lasting health concerns have become a way of life for me and many others living in the region. Despite efforts to improve the environmental domain, the effects of years of neglect have taken a toll on our individual health. It is a situation that requires immediate attention and action from the authorities to restore the health and well-being of the people living in the South Pacific.
