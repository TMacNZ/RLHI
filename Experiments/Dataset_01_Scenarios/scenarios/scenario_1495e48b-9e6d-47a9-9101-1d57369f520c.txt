The wind in the South Pacific can be quite an annoyance, particularly during the summer months. It's not so strong that it causes any damage or danger, but it's enough to make outdoor activities uncomfortable. The gusts come in fits and starts, sometimes dying down to a mere breeze before picking up again with a vengeance. The wind kicks up sand on the beaches, making it difficult to relax and enjoy the scenery. It also makes it challenging to keep hats and other loose items from flying away. Despite its annoyance, the locals have learned to live with the wind, and it's just another part of life on this beautiful continent.
