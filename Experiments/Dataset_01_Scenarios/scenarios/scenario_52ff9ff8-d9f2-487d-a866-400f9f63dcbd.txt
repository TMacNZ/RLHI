The extended family of Ahmed lived in North Africa, a region that was hit hard by a financial crisis. The situation was disruptive as many individuals were struggling to make ends meet. Ahmed's family was no exception. They were finding it increasingly difficult to put food on the table, let alone buy luxuries such as meat or fruits. Ahmed's mother, who was the sole breadwinner of the family, had lost her job due to the economic downturn. With no source of income, the family was struggling to keep up with their daily expenses. Ahmed's father, who was a philosopher, tried to find solace in the teachings of his favorite philosophers. He would often quote them and say that "life is like soup, and you need to make the best of the ingredients you have." But the reality was harsher than the philosophical musings. The family was barely surviving, and the constant struggle was taking a toll on their mental health. Despite the hardships, the family tried to remain optimistic and hoped for a better future. They knew that they had to stay strong and support each other to overcome the financial crisis.
