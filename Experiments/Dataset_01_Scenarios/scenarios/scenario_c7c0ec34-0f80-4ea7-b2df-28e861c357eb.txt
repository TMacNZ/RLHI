In the year 2215, a catastrophic health concern had spread throughout the interstellar community. The cause of the outbreak was traced back to a research facility located on a remote planet in the South American region of the galaxy. The facility was working on a new drug that could potentially cure a wide range of physical ailments, but something had gone terribly wrong during the testing phase. The drug had mutated into a deadly virus that was highly contagious and resistant to all known treatments. The interstellar community was in a state of panic as the virus quickly spread to other planets, causing widespread sickness and death. Teams of scientists and medical personnel were dispatched to the affected areas to try and contain the outbreak, but the virus seemed to be one step ahead, always evolving and adapting to new treatments. It was a race against time to find a cure before it was too late for the millions of lives that hung in the balance.
