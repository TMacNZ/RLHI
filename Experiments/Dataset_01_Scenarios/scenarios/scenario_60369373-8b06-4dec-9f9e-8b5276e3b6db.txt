In the distant future, humanity has colonized the stars and interstellar travel has become a commonplace. However, a new problem has arisen in the South Asian sector of the galaxy. A massive environmental issue has caused a severe economic strain on the local planets. The main cause of this issue is a never-ending chase for resources. Corporations and governments alike are scrambling to extract any valuable minerals or elements they can find, leading to widespread environmental destruction. The ordinary severity of the situation has led to a lack of urgency, with many turning a blind eye to the long-term consequences of their actions. The once-beautiful planets of the South Asian sector are now scarred and barren, with many species on the brink of extinction. Unless drastic measures are taken to address this intergalactic environmental issue, the economic consequences could be catastrophic for the entire sector.
