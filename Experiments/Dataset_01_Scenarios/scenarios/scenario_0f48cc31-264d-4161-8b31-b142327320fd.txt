The Middle East is facing a long-lasting environmental issue due to political decisions that have led to a draft in water resources. The region has been experiencing a decline in rainfall and water availability, exacerbated by political tensions and conflicts. The lack of access to clean water has severe consequences on the environment, affecting agriculture and livestock, leading to desertification, and contributing to the displacement of people. The governments in the region have been unable to come up with a unified approach to address the problem, and the situation is expected to worsen as the population grows and demand for water increases. The draft has become a pressing issue in the Middle East, and it will require a coordinated effort from all stakeholders to find a sustainable solution to this environmental crisis.
