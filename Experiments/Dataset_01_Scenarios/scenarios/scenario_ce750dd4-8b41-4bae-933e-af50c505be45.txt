In the Pacific region, a well-known online retailer faces a long-lasting ethical dilemma in their physical domain. It was discovered that the company's cabinet manufacturers were exploiting their workers, subjecting them to inhumane working conditions and paying them below minimum wage. To make matters worse, these cabinet manufacturers were the company's primary suppliers, and the retailer had been turning a blind eye to the exploitation for years. As the news of the unethical practices went viral on social media, the public demanded accountability and action from the retailer. The company's reputation was tarnished, and customers boycotted their products. The retailer was forced to take swift action, severing ties with the cabinet manufacturers and implementing new ethical standards for all their suppliers. The incident served as a reminder that companies must prioritize ethical practices, even if it means losing profits or facing backlash.
