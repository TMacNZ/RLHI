In the year 3050, the South Asian region experienced a critical incident that threatened intergalactic relations. The political leaders of the region had been accused of attempting to own a planet that had been designated as a common resource for all intergalactic beings. This accusation had sparked outrage among the intergalactic community, leading to a breakdown in diplomatic relations between South Asia and the rest of the galaxy. The situation had escalated to a point where an intergalactic war seemed inevitable, and the fate of the entire galaxy hung in the balance. The leaders of South Asia had to act fast to diffuse the situation and prevent a catastrophic outcome.
