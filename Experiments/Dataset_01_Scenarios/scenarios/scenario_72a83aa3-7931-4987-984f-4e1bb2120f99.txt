In the Middle East, a military commander is faced with a dangerous ethical dilemma. His superior officer has given him a command to carry out a bombing mission on what he believes is a terrorist target. However, the commander has received intelligence that suggests there may be innocent civilians in the area. This information has left him feeling emotionally conflicted, as he does not want to harm innocent people, but he also wants to follow his orders and ensure the safety of his country. The commander must decide whether to follow through with the mission and risk innocent lives or disobey orders and potentially face consequences for his actions. The weight of this decision is heavy on his mind, as he considers the consequences of both options on his conscience and his career.
