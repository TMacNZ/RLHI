In today's era of social media, the challenge of sticking to a healthy online routine has become increasingly difficult. It's easy to get lost in the endless scroll of news feeds, notifications, and messages, often leading to a decrease in productivity and an increase in stress levels. Moreover, the pressure to constantly present a picture-perfect life on social media can be overwhelming, leading to a decline in mental health. It's crucial to set boundaries for oneself and stick to them, such as limiting social media usage to a certain time of day or taking regular breaks from the screen. By doing so, one can maintain a healthy balance between online and offline life, while avoiding the negative impacts of social media addiction.
