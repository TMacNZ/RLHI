The fish market in the coastal town of Kribi had been a bustling hub of activity for generations. It was a place where fishermen and traders from neighboring villages came to sell their catch and haggle over prices. But today, the market was eerily quiet. The fishermen were nowhere to be seen, and the stalls were empty. It was the result of a violent conflict that had erupted between two rival political factions in the region. The dispute had started over control of fishing rights and had escalated into a full-blown war. The violence had spread to nearby villages, with casualties mounting on both sides. The government had imposed a curfew, and soldiers patrolled the streets to keep the peace. But the tension was palpable, and the future of the fish market, and the livelihoods of those who depended on it, hung in the balance.
