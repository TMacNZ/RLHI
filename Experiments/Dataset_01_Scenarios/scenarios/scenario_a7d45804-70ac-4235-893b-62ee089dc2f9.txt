It was a typical hot day in North Africa, and the extended family had gathered in the courtyard of their home for a celebratory lunch. The aroma of freshly cooked couscous filled the air as the family members chatted and caught up on each other's lives. Suddenly, one of the younger cousins let out a loud scream. Everyone turned to see what had happened and saw that the child had accidentally spilled a second helping of couscous on their lap. The child's parents quickly came to the rescue, wiping up the mess and comforting their son. The incident was quickly forgotten amidst the laughter and good times shared by the family. Such accidents were a common occurrence in this culturally rich and vibrant family.
