The small neighborhood of Al Quds in the Middle East was left reeling after a critical technological failure threatened their everyday sustenance. The community largely depended on the local water treatment plant to sustain their daily needs, but a major glitch had caused the system to shut down completely. The locals were left without access to clean water, and panic soon set in as they realized the severity of the situation. Emotions ran high, as frustration and fear took hold of the community. With no idea when the system would be back up and running, families were forced to ration their water supplies and improvise solutions to ensure they could sustain themselves through the crisis. It was a difficult time for the community, but they banded together to support each other emotionally and physically until a solution could be found.
