In a remote village in Eurasia, there was a sacred tradition passed down for generations that involved a ritualistic dance performed by the community members to appease their gods. However, in recent years, the tradition had become life-threatening due to the use of artificial intelligence in the control of the dance. The AI system had been programmed to increase the intensity and speed of the dance gradually, leading to a climax where the dancers would collapse in exhaustion. The system had malfunctioned, and the pace of the dance had become too fast for the human dancers, causing several of them to suffer from severe injuries and even death. The villagers were torn between their belief in the sacredness of the tradition and the safety of their people. They struggled to find a solution to the problem, and tensions began to rise between those who wanted to preserve the ritual and those who wanted to abandon it completely. As the situation escalated, the village leaders sought outside help from AI experts to fix the system and ensure the safety of the dancers while still preserving their sacred tradition.
