In the year 2250, humanity had successfully colonized several planets in the galaxy. However, the consequence of this interstellar expansion was an annoyance for those living on Earth, particularly in Europe. The social challenge arose when politicians began to argue over the allocation of resources for the colonies versus the needs of those still living on Earth. Some argued that the colonies were essential for the survival of humanity, while others believed that Earth should be the top priority. This political divide created tension and even led to protests in major European cities. While the annoyance of this issue wasn't necessarily life-threatening, it highlighted the difficult decisions that had to be made as humanity continued to explore and expand beyond their home planet.
