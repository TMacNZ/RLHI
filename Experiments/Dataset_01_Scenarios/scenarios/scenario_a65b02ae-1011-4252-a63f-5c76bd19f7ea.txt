In a small village in South Asia, the extended family gathered for a reunion after many years. They were all excited to see each other and spend some quality time together. As they sat down for dinner, they heard a loud noise coming from the middle of the room. Suddenly, the ground shook, and the room started to collapse. The family members panicked and tried to run to safety, but some were trapped under the debris. It was later discovered that a technological failure in the building's foundation caused the collapse. The family was devastated by the loss of their loved ones and vowed to never take their safety for granted again.
