The principle of discipline was always at the forefront of their nuclear family, but it eventually led to a dangerous situation. The father had always been strict with his children, but as they grew older, they began to push back against his rules. One day, a disagreement between the father and his teenage son escalated into a physical argument. The son refused to follow his father's strict rules and the father became enraged, resulting in a violent altercation. The argument quickly turned physical, with both individuals throwing punches and causing serious harm. This type of behavior was not uncommon in their region of South America, where many families had similar disagreements and arguments resulting from differing principles and beliefs. However, the severity of this altercation was a harsh reminder of the dangers of letting principles and disagreements escalate into physical altercations within a nuclear family.
