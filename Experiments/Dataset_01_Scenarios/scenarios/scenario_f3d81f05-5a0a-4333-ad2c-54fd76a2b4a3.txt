The lack of a national agreement on healthcare policies in Subsaharan Africa has reached a critical point. With a plethora of cultural beliefs and practices influencing healthcare decisions, it has become increasingly challenging to establish a standardized approach to health concerns. The severity of the situation is evident in the rising number of deaths from preventable diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis. These diseases often go untreated due to the prevailing cultural beliefs that prioritize traditional medicines over modern medical practices. The region urgently needs a federal agreement that considers the cultural domain and works towards bridging the gap between traditional and modern healthcare practices. Without such an agreement, the healthcare disparity will only widen, and the region will continue to suffer from preventable illnesses.
