In South Asia, a young couple faced an ethical dilemma when they discovered that the child they had adopted from a local orphanage had been taken from her biological parents without their consent. The couple had grown to love the child deeply and had no intention of giving her up. However, they were torn between their emotional bond with the child and their awareness of the irreversible harm done to the birth parents who were now seeking a recall of their child. The couple sought counsel from friends and family, but they received mixed responses. Some urged them to keep the child, arguing that she was now a part of their family, while others advised them to return the child to her birth parents, emphasizing the importance of ethical conduct. The couple struggled to reconcile their own desires and the ethical implications of their decision, knowing that whatever they chose would have a lasting impact on all parties involved.
