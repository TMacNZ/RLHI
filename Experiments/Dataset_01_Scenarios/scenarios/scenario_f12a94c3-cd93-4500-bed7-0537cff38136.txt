The Johnsons were a typical nuclear family living in the heart of Washington D.C. They had always been aware of the political unrest that simmered just beneath the surface of the city, but they had never thought it would directly affect them. However, when the economic domain was hit hard by the unrest, they found themselves struggling to make ends meet. Mr. Johnson's job as a government contractor had always been stable, but with the government in disarray, his job was suddenly on the line. Mrs. Johnson had lost her part-time job at a local boutique due to decreased consumer spending, and their two children were feeling the effects of their parents' stress. The family had to cut back on expenses, cancel vacations, and forego extracurricular activities. The political unrest had taken a toll on the Johnsons' once comfortable lifestyle, and they were unsure of when things would return to normal.
