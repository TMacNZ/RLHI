In many parts of North Africa, it's a typical social challenge for relatives to interfere with physical matters of their family members. Aunts, uncles, and even distant cousins feel a sense of entitlement to dictate what their family members should wear, eat, and how they should behave in public. This interference often leads to a lack of personal autonomy and can even result in physical harm. For instance, a relative may insist that a female family member wear a particular type of clothing, regardless of her preference, and may even resort to violence if the family member refuses to comply. This issue is prevalent across the region and requires a concerted effort to promote personal autonomy and educate individuals on the importance of respecting other's choices and boundaries.
