The financial crisis in the educational sector in North Africa has reached a critical point. The gatekeepers of higher education, the universities, are struggling to keep their doors open due to a lack of funding. As a result, students are facing increased tuition fees and reduced access to resources, such as libraries and technology. The severity of the situation is such that many universities are on the brink of closure, leaving thousands of aspiring students with no educational opportunities. The region's economy is also affected as the lack of skilled graduates hinders growth and development. Urgent action is needed to address the financial crisis and ensure that the gate to higher education remains open to all.
