In the year 2065, the intergalactic community was buzzing with excitement over the new technological advancements that were being developed across the galaxy. However, a catastrophic failure in a new economic system had devastating effects on the South Asian region. The system, designed to streamline financial transactions and boost the economy, was supposed to be foolproof. But a glitch in the system caused a complete shutdown, leaving countless businesses and individuals in financial ruin. One of the hardest hit was a small Palestinian-owned business that had recently expanded to South Asia. The economic disaster forced the business to close its doors, leaving its employees jobless and the owner struggling to pay off debts. The intergalactic community was left reeling, with many questioning the safety and reliability of the new technologies that were being developed.
