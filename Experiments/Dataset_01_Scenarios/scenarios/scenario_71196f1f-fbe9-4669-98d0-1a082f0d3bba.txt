The small town of Maka'ala had always been a peaceful place, where neighbors helped each other and violence was unheard of. However, that all changed when the new mayor was elected. He was a divisive figure, known for his controversial policies and dismissive attitude towards the concerns of the community. As time went on, tensions began to rise between his supporters and those who opposed him. It all came to a head when a group of protesters marched to City Hall, demanding that the mayor listen to their grievances. But instead of engaging in a dialogue, he had them forcibly removed by the police. This act of aggression sparked a wave of emotional unrest throughout the town, with many feeling betrayed by their elected leader. The incident left a lasting scar on the community, and it would take years for the wounds to heal.
