The CEO of the multinational corporation sat in her spacious office overlooking the Pacific Ocean, her laptop resting in her lap. She had been keeping a close eye on the financial markets and was relieved to see that the slight dip in the stock prices had not affected their bottom line. It was an insignificant blip on the radar, but she knew that any disturbance in the economic domain could have serious consequences. She made a mental note to discuss their contingency plans with the CFO at their next meeting, just in case a more severe financial crisis were to occur. For now, she closed her laptop and gazed out at the calming blue waters, grateful for the momentary lap of stability in an otherwise unpredictable business world.
