In a small village nestled in the heart of Eurasia, a disruptive social challenge has arisen. The issue at hand is deeply cultural in nature, as it pertains to the longstanding tradition of only marrying within one's own ethnicity. However, with the influx of outsiders into the village, the once homogenous population has become more diverse, leading to tension and conflict. The severity of the situation has only increased with the emergence of a group of young people who are challenging this tradition, advocating for acceptance and integration of all people, regardless of their ethnicity. This has sparked intense debate and heated arguments among the villagers, with some seeing the movement as a betrayal of their cultural heritage, while others view it as a necessary step towards progress and unity. The tension is palpable, and the brown fields surrounding the village seem to reflect the uncertainty and division within the community.
