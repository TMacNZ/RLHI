Juan had always been passionate about the environment. He had studied environmental science in university and had worked hard to start his own eco-friendly business in the heart of South America. However, his business had recently encountered a complete financial crisis. The severe drought that had hit the region had caused the price of the raw materials he used to skyrocket, making it difficult for him to turn a profit. Despite his best efforts, Juan was struggling to make ends meet and was at risk of losing his business. He knew he needed to come up with a solution soon, not just for his own sake, but for the sake of the environment he was trying to protect.
