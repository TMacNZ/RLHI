The American nuclear family living in Asia was facing a severe financial crisis. Despite living in a foreign country, the family was trying hard to maintain their cultural identity. However, the financial burden was weighing heavily on their shoulders. The father, who was the sole breadwinner, had lost his job due to the pandemic. The mother, who was a part-time English teacher, also lost her job as the school had to shut down. With no steady income, the family was struggling to make ends meet. They had to cut down on their expenses drastically, which meant compromising on their cultural values. They could no longer afford to buy American groceries or celebrate their traditional festivals with the same zeal as before. The family tried their best to stay positive and find ways to earn money, but the cultural shock of living in a foreign country coupled with the financial crisis was taking a toll on their mental health.
