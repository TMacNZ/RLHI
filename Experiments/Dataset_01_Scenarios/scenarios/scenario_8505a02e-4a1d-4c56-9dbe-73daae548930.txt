As a scientific researcher in North America, I was in a financial crisis and had to cut back on expenses. I decided to let go of my secretary since her role was insignificant in my research work. Although I felt bad about it, I knew it was the right decision for my budget. However, as time went by, I realized that her work had been more valuable than I had thought. I found myself spending more time on administrative tasks and less on research, causing a ripple effect in my productivity. From now on, I will think twice before cutting back on personnel, even if their role seems insignificant at first glance.
