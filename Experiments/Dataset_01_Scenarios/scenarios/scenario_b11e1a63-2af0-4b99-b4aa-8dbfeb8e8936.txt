In a small town in South America, a group of teachers at a local school are finding it increasingly difficult to work together. They feel as though they are drifting apart, and there is a sense of conflict and tension between them. The root of the issue is unclear, but some suspect that it may be related to the political unrest that has been sweeping the country. Despite some minor disagreements, the severity of the situation is relatively insignificant, and most of the teachers are still able to work collaboratively. However, the tension and conflict are beginning to impact the educational domain, as students are starting to notice the strained relationships between their teachers. The school administration is aware of the situation and is actively working to address the issue and find a resolution that will bring the teachers back together.
