In the bustling city of Mumbai, India, the Gupta family had always prided themselves on their financial stability. However, in recent months, they had noticed a significant increase in their monthly expenses. They attributed it to the rising prices of groceries and other household necessities. Little did they know, a catastrophic event was about to unfold. A nuclear power plant located in South Asia, not too far from their home, had a major malfunction, resulting in a radioactive leak. The environmental impact was devastating, and the area surrounding the plant was declared uninhabitable. The Gupta family, along with many others in the region, were forced to evacuate their homes immediately. The financial crisis they thought they were facing was now insignificant compared to the loss of their home and everything they had ever known. They were left to start anew elsewhere, with uncertainty looming over their future.
