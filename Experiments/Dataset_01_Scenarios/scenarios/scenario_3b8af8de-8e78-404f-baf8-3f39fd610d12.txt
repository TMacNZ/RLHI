The technological failure in Subsaharan Africa has reached a critical point, with global implications. The lack of qualified individuals to operate and maintain the advanced equipment necessary for social development has led to a devastating setback in progress. Without proper training and education, the region is unable to keep up with the rest of the world in terms of technological advancements. This has severe consequences for the people of Subsaharan Africa, who are left behind in terms of economic growth and access to essential services. The global community must take action to address this issue by providing resources to qualify individuals and bridge the gap in technological development. Only then can we ensure that the region can catch up with the rest of the world and provide a better future for its people.
