In South Asia, a catastrophic environmental issue has arisen due to the widespread use of fans. As the region experiences prolonged heatwaves, the demand for electric fans has skyrocketed, leading to a devastating strain on the power grid. With power outages becoming more frequent and lasting for longer periods of time, people are left without a means to cool themselves down in the scorching heat. The situation has caused immense social unrest, with protests erupting across the region demanding a solution to the power crisis. The government has been forced to declare a state of emergency as the situation continues to escalate, with hospitals struggling to cope with the increasing number of heat-related illnesses. The region is facing an unprecedented environmental and social crisis, and urgent action is needed to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control.
