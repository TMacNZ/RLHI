In a small town in South Asia, a woman named Aisha was frantically running around the local shop, searching for medicine to calm her racing heart. Aisha had been experiencing severe emotional distress for weeks, but was too afraid to seek help. As she reached the counter, she suddenly collapsed, gasping for breath. The shopkeeper quickly called for an ambulance, but it was a long way off, as they were in a remote part of the country. Aisha's life was now in danger, and she felt helpless and alone. The severity of the situation was overwhelming, and Aisha couldn't help but think of her family and the life she would leave behind if she didn't make it through this health concern. The shop, which was once a place of comfort, had become a scene of life-threatening danger for Aisha.
