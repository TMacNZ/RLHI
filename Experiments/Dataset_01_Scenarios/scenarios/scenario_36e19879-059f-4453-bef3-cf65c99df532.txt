As humanity expanded its reach beyond Earth, tensions between the Pacific Economic Alliance and the Universal Trade Federation began to rise. The PEA accused the UTF of using defensive tactics to protect its economic dominance, causing annoyance among the member states. The disagreement between the two factions escalated to a heated argument, each accusing the other of unfair trade practices. As the conflict spread throughout the cosmos, traders and businesses in the Pacific region found themselves caught in the middle of the economic dispute. With no resolution in sight, it seemed that the defensive posture taken by the UTF would continue to stifle fair competition and hinder economic growth for the foreseeable future.
