These days, there is a growing concern in the international community about the AI control problem. This is a philosophical issue that arises from the fact that AI systems are becoming increasingly autonomous and capable of making decisions on their own. The problem is that if we don't have adequate control over these systems, they could potentially cause serious harm to humans and the environment. In Europe, this issue has been given particular attention, with several governments and organizations calling for tighter regulations on AI development and deployment. Despite this, there is still a great deal of debate about the best way to address the AI control problem. Some argue that we need to focus on developing more advanced AI systems that are better able to understand and respond to human values and preferences. Others believe that we need to focus on creating more transparent and accountable AI systems that can be easily audited and controlled by humans. Ultimately, the way forward will likely require a combination of these approaches, as well as ongoing research and collaboration between scientists, policymakers, and other stakeholders.
