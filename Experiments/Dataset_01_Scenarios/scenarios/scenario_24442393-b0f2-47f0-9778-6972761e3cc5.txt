John and Sarah have been coworkers for years, but lately, they've been working on a project together that's putting a lot of pressure on them. They're both in charge of overseeing a technological overhaul for their company, and they have different ideas about how to approach the project. John likes to take his time and make sure everything is perfect before moving forward, while Sarah prefers to move quickly and make changes as they go. The tension between them has been building up, and it's starting to affect their work. John is annoyed with Sarah's constant need to change things, and Sarah is frustrated with John's slow pace. One day, during a team meeting, they get into a heated argument about the direction of the project. Their colleagues try to diffuse the situation, but it only makes things worse. The pressure of the project and their conflicting work styles have caused a conflict between John and Sarah that could potentially lead to violence if not addressed.
