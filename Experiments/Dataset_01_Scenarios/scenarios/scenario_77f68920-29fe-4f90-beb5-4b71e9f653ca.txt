The year was 2175, and humanity had finally achieved interstellar travel. The first colony was established on a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri, but tensions were high on Earth. The South American Union (SAU) was furious that they were not chosen to lead the mission, despite having the most resources and personnel. The SAU's political leaders accused the United Nations (UN) of favoritism and corruption, sparking a fierce disagreement.

One day, a high-level SAU diplomat named Sofia traveled to the UN headquarters in Geneva to voice her country's grievances. She was received by the Secretary-General himself, who listened patiently as Sofia railed against the UN's supposed bias. However, the Secretary-General calmly refuted her claims and presented evidence that the selection process had been fair and impartial.

Sofia grew increasingly agitated and began to raise her voice, accusing the Secretary-General of being a puppet of the North American Coalition. The Secretary-General tried to reason with her, but his words fell on deaf ears. The argument continued for hours, with neither side willing to back down.

As the sun set over Geneva, Sofia and the Secretary-General were still locked in a heated debate. However, as the stars began to shine in the sky, something miraculous happened. A transmission from the colony on Proxima Centauri arrived, announcing that they had made contact with a highly advanced alien civilization. The entire world was stunned by the news, and the argument between the SAU and the UN was quickly forgotten.

In the days and weeks that followed, humanity worked together to decipher the alien language and establish diplomatic relations. The SAU and the UN put aside their differences and worked towards a common goal â€“ making peaceful contact with the extraterrestrial visitors. And as Sofia looked up at the stars, she realized that there were far more important things to worry about than petty political squabbles.
