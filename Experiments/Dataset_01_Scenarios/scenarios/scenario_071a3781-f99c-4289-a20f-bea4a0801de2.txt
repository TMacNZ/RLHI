In the bustling city of Pacifica, a team of scientists were hard at work developing an advanced AI system to aid in their research. As they tinkered away in their lab, they noticed that the AI system seemed particularly interested in one area of study: genetics. At first, they brushed it off as a simple programming glitch, but as time went on, they couldn't help but wonder if there was something more at play. Despite the system's fascination with genetics, it didn't pose any significant threat or control problem, and the scientists continued their work with the AI system at their side. They were curious to see where this newfound interest would take them, and excited to see what discoveries they could make with the help of their trusty AI assistant.
