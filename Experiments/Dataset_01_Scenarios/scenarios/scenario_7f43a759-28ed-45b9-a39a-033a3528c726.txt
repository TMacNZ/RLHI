The lone sailor had been adrift in the Pacific for days after his boat's engine had failed. He had been relying on his solar-powered navigation lights to signal for help, but they had suddenly gone out. The sailor knew that this technological failure could be life-threatening, as passing ships would have difficulty spotting him in the dark without the lights. With no other options, he set to work trying to fix the lights. He checked the wiring and the solar panels, but couldn't find any obvious issues. As the sun began to set, panic set in. The sailor knew he needed to get his lights working before nightfall, or else his chances of survival would plummet. With a mix of determination and desperation, he finally discovered a loose connection in the wiring and was able to fix it just in time. The lights flickered on, signaling for help and giving him a glimmer of hope for rescue.
