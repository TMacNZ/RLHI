In Subsaharan Africa, a group of schoolchildren eagerly gathered around a donated bicycle, excitedly discussing who would get to ride it first. However, their excitement was short-lived as the bike failed to start. The children tried to fix it themselves, but to no avail. The disappointment on their faces was palpable, as they had hoped to use the bike to make their long and tiring journey to school easier. Despite the insignificant severity of the technological failure, the emotional impact on the children was significant, highlighting the importance of reliable transportation in this region.
