It was a beautiful day in North America, and Jane was out for a walk in the park. As she was walking near the pond, she noticed a group of people gathered around, arguing loudly. Curiosity got the best of her, and she decided to investigate. As she got closer, she saw that the argument was over a game of frisbee. One person had thrown the frisbee too far, and it had landed in the pond. Another person was upset because they didn't want to go into the water to retrieve it. Jane watched as the group continued to argue, each person getting more and more frustrated. Eventually, Jane decided to get involved. She walked up to the group and calmly suggested that they could all pitch in and buy a new frisbee instead of arguing over the old one. The group agreed, and the argument was resolved. Jane continued on her walk, feeling satisfied that she had helped resolve a disagreement.
