In a distant galaxy, a catastrophic situation has arisen in the Middle East. A new technological device, designed to help with food processing and distribution, has malfunctioned and contaminated all the plates it has come into contact with. This has resulted in a health concern that is spreading rapidly across the region. The device, which was designed to handle intergalactic food, has caused an unknown and deadly virus to spread through the plates, infecting anyone who consumes food from them. The virus has proven to be resistant to all known treatments, and the infected individuals are experiencing severe symptoms that are leading to death within days. The situation is dire, and the intergalactic community is scrambling to find a solution to this unforeseen and deadly problem.
