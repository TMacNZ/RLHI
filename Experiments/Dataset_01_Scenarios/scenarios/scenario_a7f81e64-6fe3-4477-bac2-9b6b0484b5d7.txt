The North African country was in the midst of political unrest, with protests and demonstrations becoming an everyday occurrence. In an effort to curb the chaos, the government decided to adopt a new technological solution: a social media monitoring system. This system was designed to track and flag any suspicious activity online, including posts related to the ongoing protests. However, the adoption of this system proved to be catastrophic. The government used it to suppress dissenting voices, arresting and torturing those who spoke out against them. The system also had a chilling effect on free speech, with many citizens afraid to voice their opinions online for fear of retribution. As a result, the situation in North Africa only grew more tense, with the government's attempts to control the narrative exacerbating the very unrest they were trying to quell.
