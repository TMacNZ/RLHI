In South America, a phenomenon has emerged in the legal system related to the control of AI. As more companies and individuals rely on AI for decision-making, there has been a growing concern about who is responsible for the actions of AI systems. In some cases, AI has been used to make decisions that have negatively impacted individuals, raising questions about accountability. The legal system is struggling to keep up with this rapidly evolving field, leading to inconsistencies in court rulings and confusion among lawyers and judges. The ordinary severity of this issue is causing frustration for those seeking justice in cases involving AI. As a result, there is a growing push for clearer laws and regulations to govern AI and its use in decision-making. The interpersonal relationships between individuals and AI systems are becoming more complex, leading to the need for legal clarity and accountability.
