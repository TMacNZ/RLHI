A heated debate erupted in the halls of the Asian Institute of Astrophysics, as two renowned astronomers squared off over the role of coal in the universe. Dr. Lee argued that coal was a critical component of the cosmic evolutionary process, pointing to the abundance of carbon-based compounds found in distant galaxies. However, Dr. Singh vehemently disagreed, insisting that coal was a mere byproduct of planetary formation and held no significant cosmic importance. As the argument escalated, tensions flared and accusations were hurled back and forth, threatening to derail the entire conference. It was clear that this disagreement was not just a trivial matter, but a serious intellectual dispute that could have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the universe.
