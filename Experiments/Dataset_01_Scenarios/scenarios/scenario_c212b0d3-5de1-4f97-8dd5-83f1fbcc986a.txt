In a distant corner of the universe, on a planet in the Eurasian region, an ethical dilemma was unfolding. The planet's inhabitants had discovered a rare substance that could cure any kind of life-threatening disease. This substance was found in the hair of a particular species of animal that lived only in a small area of the planet. The discovery of this substance had the potential to revolutionize medicine across the universe. However, the only way to extract this substance was by killing the animal, making it an economic decision for the inhabitants. The ethical dilemma arose when the inhabitants had to weigh the economic benefits against the moral implications of killing an entire species for their own gain. The decision they make could have far-reaching consequences across the universe.
