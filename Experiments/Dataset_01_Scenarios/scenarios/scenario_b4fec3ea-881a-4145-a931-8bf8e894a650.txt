With the rise of social media in the South Pacific, there has been an expansion of online communities that has led to a social challenge. People are becoming more emotionally invested in their virtual lives than their real ones, causing them to neglect their personal relationships and responsibilities. This has resulted in a generation of individuals who are struggling to connect with others on a deeper level, leaving them feeling isolated and alone. While the internet has brought people closer together in some ways, it has also created a divide that is difficult to bridge. As people continue to expand their online presence, it is important to remember to nurture the connections we have in the physical world and not let our virtual lives consume us.
