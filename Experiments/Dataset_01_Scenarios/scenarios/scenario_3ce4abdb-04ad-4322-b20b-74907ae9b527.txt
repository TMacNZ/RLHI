In the southern region of South America, there is a political concern regarding the access to healthcare for the population. The issue at hand is that many individuals are only able to see a doctor once, due to the lack of resources and financial means. This means that individuals are not receiving adequate follow-up care or treatment for chronic conditions. The government is aware of this issue and has implemented programs to try and improve access to healthcare, but progress has been slow. While this may be considered an insignificant concern in the grand scheme of things, it is still a pressing issue for those who are affected and highlights the need for continued efforts to improve healthcare access and equity on an international scale.
