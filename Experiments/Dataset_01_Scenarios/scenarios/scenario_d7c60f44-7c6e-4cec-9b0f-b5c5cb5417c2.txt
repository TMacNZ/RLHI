It was a critical moment for the Pacific region's educational system. The discovery of an ethical dilemma had sent shockwaves through the community. It all started when a group of students from a local high school found out that their final exams had been altered. The clock on the test was set 10 minutes ahead, giving students less time to complete the exam. The school administration had done this to see how the students would react under pressure. The news of this unethical practice spread like wildfire, sparking outrage among parents, students, and educators alike. The school was now facing a crisis, and the state educational board had to step in to investigate the matter. The fate of the school, and the trust of the community, was in jeopardy, and everyone was waiting anxiously for the outcome of the investigation.
