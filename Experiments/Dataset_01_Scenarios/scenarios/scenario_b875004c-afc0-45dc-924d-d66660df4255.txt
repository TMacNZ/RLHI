A massive earthquake of 8.5 magnitude hit the Eurasian region, causing widespread destruction and chaos. The earthquake triggered a series of aftershocks that lasted for days, leading to the collapse of numerous buildings and infrastructure. The most challenging problem was the damage to the technological domain, as the earthquake caused a massive squeeze on the fiber optic cables running across the region. The internet and communication networks were down for weeks, leaving people disconnected from the rest of the world. The government authorities and international organizations worked tirelessly to restore the technological domain, but the long-lasting impact of the earthquake made it a challenging task. The disaster brought to light the importance of having a robust and resilient technological infrastructure, and the authorities took measures to ensure such an event would not occur again.
