In the year 2100, a new trend swept across the galaxy: emotional technology. People everywhere were using devices to monitor and regulate their emotions, and the market was booming. However, in South America, there was a sudden technological failure that left thousands of people without access to their emotional regulation devices. Panic spread quickly as people struggled to cope with their emotions without the help of their devices. The failure was traced back to a software glitch, but the company responsible was slow to respond. As the days went on, the situation became more and more dire, with people experiencing extreme emotional highs and lows. Some even turned to violence as they were unable to control their emotions. Eventually, a team of tech experts from around the galaxy came together to fix the issue and restore emotional stability to the region. However, the incident served as a wake-up call for the dangers of relying too heavily on technology to regulate our emotions, and many people began to question the trend that had once seemed so appealing.
