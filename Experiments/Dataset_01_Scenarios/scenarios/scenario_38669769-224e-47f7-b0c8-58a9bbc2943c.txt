As I was reading my favorite book, I suddenly felt a slight tremor under my feet. At first, I thought it was just the subway passing by, but the shaking continued for a few seconds longer. I looked around and saw that some of the other patrons in the coffee shop were also looking concerned. 

Just as I was about to ask someone if they felt the tremor too, the overhead lights flickered and then went out completely. Panic set in as people started to frantically search for their phones to use as a flashlight. The barista came out from behind the counter and announced that there had been an earthquake and that they needed to evacuate the building immediately. 

As we made our way outside, I couldn't believe the chaos that surrounded me. People were shouting and crying, some holding onto each other for support. The street was littered with fallen debris and shattered glass from nearby buildings. 

I quickly realized that the inconvenience of not being able to finish my book was nothing compared to the devastation that this natural disaster had caused. Despite the annoyance of having to leave my cozy reading spot, I felt grateful to be alive and unharmed.
