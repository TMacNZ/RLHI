Rose and her friend, Lily, have been close since childhood. They both grew up in a small town in the Pacific region and have always been each other's confidants. However, things have started to sour between them lately. Rose has been pursuing a degree in philosophy and has been very vocal about her beliefs on various topics such as religion and politics. Lily, on the other hand, holds conservative views and has been feeling attacked by Rose's intellectual arguments. One day, during a heated debate, Lily made a comment that Rose felt was a personal attack. Rose responded with a cutting remark, and their conversation quickly escalated into a shouting match. The argument ended with Rose storming out of the room, leaving Lily feeling hurt and confused. The once-close friends are now in conflict, and it remains to be seen whether they can reconcile their differences and repair their relationship.
