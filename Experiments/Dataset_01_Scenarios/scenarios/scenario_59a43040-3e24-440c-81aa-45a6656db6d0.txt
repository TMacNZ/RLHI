Towards the end of their family vacation in North Africa, the extended family decided to take a hike through the rugged terrain. As they trekked towards a nearby mountain, they were met with unexpected weather conditions. The sky darkened, and strong winds began to pick up. Suddenly, a flash flood emerged from nearby mountains and rushed towards them, sweeping up everything in its path. The family scrambled to higher ground, but the violent current proved too strong for some members. They were swept away towards the river, and the family frantically searched for them amidst the chaos. It was a dangerous situation, and they were in a remote location with no means of communication. The family's survival instincts kicked in as they worked together to overcome the harsh environment and find their missing relatives.
