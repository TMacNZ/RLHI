In South Asia, there has been a growing concern over the dangerous social challenge of online radicalization of young men, including sons. With the widespread use of technology and social media platforms, extremist groups have been able to target vulnerable individuals and propagate their ideologies, leading to an increase in violent extremism in the region. Many of these young men are lured into joining extremist groups through online recruitment and propaganda, which can ultimately lead to acts of terrorism. The technological domain has played a significant role in facilitating this problem, as extremist groups have been able to use advanced online tactics to reach a larger audience and recruit more members. Governments and civil society organizations in the region have been working to address this issue by implementing counter-radicalization programs and monitoring online activity. However, the severity of the problem requires more concerted efforts to prevent the radicalization of young men, including sons, and to ensure the safety and security of the region.
