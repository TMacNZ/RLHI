In the year 2150, humanity had expanded beyond Earth and established colonies on various planets throughout the galaxy. However, the employment rates on Earth remained a critical issue, with millions of people struggling to find work due to the increasing use of automation and the lack of job opportunities in the interstellar colonies. The situation took a catastrophic turn when an environmental issue arose in North America, where a failure in the terraforming machinery caused a sudden and massive release of toxic gases that contaminated the air and water supplies. The scientific community was baffled by the severity and speed of the contamination, and the initial estimates suggested that it could take decades, if not centuries, to restore the region's ecosystem. The devastating impact on the employment rates was immediate, with thousands of people losing their jobs in agriculture, manufacturing, and service sectors. The situation was grim, and the government struggled to provide adequate assistance to the affected population. The interstellar colonies, too, were affected, as the sudden collapse of the Earth's ecosystem had a ripple effect on the galactic economy. The catastrophe served as a wake-up call for humanity, highlighting the need for sustainable development practices and the importance of preserving the natural environment.
