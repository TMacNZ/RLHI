In a distant corner of the universe, a cosmic conflict had been raging for eons. Two powerful civilizations, each with their own set of beliefs and values, had been locked in a bitter struggle for supremacy. The conflict had spread across the galaxy, engulfing countless star systems and claiming countless lives. Among the many affected worlds was a small planet located in the Eurasian region of the universe. The inhabitants of this world had long been aware of the cosmic conflict, but had managed to avoid being drawn into it. However, as the conflict dragged on, tensions began to rise among the planet's various factions. The more militant groups began to advocate for taking sides and joining the fight, while others argued that the planet should remain neutral and try to stay out of harm's way. As the debate raged on, many began to fear that the conflict would eventually find its way to their doorstep, forcing them to either hide or fight for their survival. The long-lasting severity of this cosmic conflict meant that there was no easy way out for this small planet in the vast expanse of the universe.
