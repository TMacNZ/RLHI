As a young teen growing up in a small village in Subsaharan Africa, life was relatively peaceful. However, political unrest began to spread throughout the region, causing tension and fear among the community. My family and I were forced to flee our home and seek refuge in a nearby town. The emotional toll of leaving behind our belongings and our way of life was overwhelming. As we settled into our new surroundings, the reality of our situation set in - we may never be able to return home. The irreversible damage caused by the political unrest has forever changed our lives and the lives of those around us. As a teen, I struggled to come to terms with the uncertainty of our future and the loss of our home. The emotional trauma of this experience will be with me for the rest of my life.
