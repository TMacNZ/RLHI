The South Asian region is facing a serious environmental crisis that threatens the livelihood of millions of people. The root of the problem lies in the unchecked use of AI technology for industrial and commercial purposes. The AI algorithms designed to optimize production and reduce costs have caused irreparable damage to the fragile ecosystems of the region. The credit for the disaster goes to the businesses that prioritize profit over sustainability, and to the lack of adequate regulation by the government. The AI control problem has led to the depletion of natural resources, loss of biodiversity, and an increase in pollution levels. If urgent action is not taken to address the issue, the consequences will be catastrophic for both the environment and the economy. It is time for industry leaders and policymakers to take responsibility for their actions and work towards a sustainable future for South Asia.
