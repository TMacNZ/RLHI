In the year 2055, the first interstellar colony was established on a distant planet. However, the colony's attempt at creating a new society was not without its challenges. One of the most pressing issues was the use of cell phones. The colonists had brought their devices from Earth, not realizing that the planet's unique electromagnetic field caused interference with the cell phone's signal. As a result, the colonists had to rely on the outdated and unreliable communication systems provided by the colony. This led to a social challenge, as the colonists who were used to having constant access to information and communication with their loved ones back on Earth, were now cut off from the rest of the galaxy. The situation became so severe that a legal debate arose as to whether the colony should invest in developing its own communication technology or whether the colonists should be forced to adapt to their new way of life without cell phones. The debate sparked tension between different factions of the colony, with some arguing that the technology was necessary for survival while others believed that it was a luxury that they could no longer afford.
