In many cultures throughout the Pacific region, the concept of "chosen family" is deeply ingrained. These are the people who are not related by blood or marriage, but who are considered family nonetheless. However, a recent analysis has revealed a potentially disruptive health concern within these communities. Many people within chosen families may not have access to the same healthcare resources as those within traditional family structures. This could lead to undiagnosed and untreated medical conditions, especially in the case of chronic illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease. It is important for healthcare providers and community leaders to address this cultural domain and work to ensure that all members of chosen families receive the care they need to maintain their health and wellbeing.
