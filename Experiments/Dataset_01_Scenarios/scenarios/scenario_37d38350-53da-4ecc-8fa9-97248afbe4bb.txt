The recent move towards remote work in the Eurasian region has raised concerns about the impact on employees' health. Specifically, there is growing concern about the negative impact of prolonged sitting and lack of physical activity on employee health. Technological innovations such as video conferencing and virtual collaboration tools have made it easier for professionals to work from home or from remote locations, but the sedentary nature of these jobs can lead to a host of health problems. To address this concern, many companies are implementing health and wellness programs for their remote employees. These programs may include virtual fitness classes, wellness coaching, and ergonomic assessments to ensure that employees have the tools and resources they need to stay healthy and productive while working remotely. While the move towards remote work has many benefits, it is important to prioritize employee health and well-being to ensure that professionals in the Eurasian region are able to thrive both personally and professionally.
