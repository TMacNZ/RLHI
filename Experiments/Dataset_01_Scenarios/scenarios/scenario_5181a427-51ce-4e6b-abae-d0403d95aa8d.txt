In a small village nestled in the lush rainforests of South America, an extended family of farmers depends on technology to sustain their livelihoods. They rely on a complex network of machines and devices to irrigate their crops, process their harvests, and communicate with the outside world. However, one day, a catastrophic technological failure occurs, and the consequences are irreversible. The machines that once hummed with life fall silent, and the family is left with no means of sustaining their crops or communicating with the outside world. As days go by, the family begins to feel the devastating effects of the failure. Their crops wither and die, their animals grow weak and malnourished, and their once-thriving community begins to fall apart. Without a solution to the technological failure, the family faces an uncertain future in a world that is rapidly leaving them behind.
