As Anna was walking down the dimly lit hallway of her apartment building in Moscow, she noticed that one of the light bulbs had gone out. She felt a twinge of annoyance, knowing that the landlord was slow to fix these kinds of issues. She continued down the hallway, her eyes adjusting to the darkness, when suddenly she tripped over a discarded shoe and fell hard onto the concrete floor. The pain shot up her arm, and she realized she had sprained her wrist. She cursed under her breath, knowing that this would throw a wrench in her plans for the coming week. As she struggled to get up, she looked up at the flickering light bulb above her, wishing that someone would come and fix it before another resident suffered a similar accident.
