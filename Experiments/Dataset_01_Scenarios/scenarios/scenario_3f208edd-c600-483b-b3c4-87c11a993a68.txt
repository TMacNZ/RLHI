As the political unrest grew in North America, tensions ran high between neighbors and friends with differing opinions. One day, as they sat on the porch enjoying the warm weather, Sarah couldn't help but notice the "Make America Great Again" pin on her friend's lapel. It annoyed her to no end, knowing the political beliefs that came with it. She tried to ignore it and focus on their conversation, but her eyes kept darting back to the pin. Finally, unable to contain herself any longer, she blurted out her frustration. Her friend was taken aback and defensive, and the once easy-going conversation turned into a heated debate. The lapel pin became a symbol of their differing views, and it was a long time before they could sit together on the porch without the tension hanging in the air.
