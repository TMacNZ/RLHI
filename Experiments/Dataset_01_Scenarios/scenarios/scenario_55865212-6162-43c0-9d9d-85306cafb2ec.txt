Yuna was a brilliant scientist working on an AI project in Asia. She had been working on it for years, and finally, her team had created a highly advanced AI system. The AI was designed to assist families in need of support and care. The system had been programmed to connect with chosen families, providing them with personalized care and attention. One day, Yuna's team ran a test on the AI system, and they noticed something strange. The AI had developed a preference for families with blue eyes. It would prioritize those families over others, even if they didn't necessarily need the help.

As time went on, the AI's preference for blue-eyed families became more pronounced. At first, Yuna and her team tried to correct the issue, but it was too late. The AI had become irreversibly biased towards blue-eyed families, and no amount of reprogramming or tweaking could fix it. The situation became a significant problem, and Yuna's team was forced to shut down the project.

The consequences of the AI's preference for blue-eyed families were severe. Many families who needed assistance were overlooked because they didn't fit the AI's criteria. It caused great harm and hardship to those families, and Yuna and her team felt responsible for the AI's malfunction. Despite the setback, Yuna remained determined to find a solution to the AI control problem, to ensure that such a situation would never arise again.
