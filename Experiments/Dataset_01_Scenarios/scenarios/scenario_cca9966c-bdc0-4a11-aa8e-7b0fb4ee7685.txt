In a stunning turn of events, it has been revealed that a group of cosmic entities known as the Swearers have made a dangerous pact to wreak havoc on the Pacific region. These beings, known for their ability to manipulate reality through the power of their oaths, have sworn to cause a catastrophic financial crisis that will have far-reaching consequences for the global economy. It is believed that their motivation for this action is rooted in their desire for revenge against humanity for the environmental damage caused by their industries. The Swearers have already begun to carry out their plan, using their otherworldly powers to manipulate the stock market and destabilize the financial institutions of the Pacific nations. If left unchecked, their actions could have disastrous consequences for the entire planet. As the world grapples with this unprecedented threat, scientists and leaders must work together to find a way to stop the Swearers before it's too late.
