In a small village nestled in the heart of the Amazon rainforest in South America, the rainy season had arrived. The constant downpour had made everything around the village wet, including the villagers' homes and farms. The villagers had always been used to the rain, but this season seemed to be never-ending. The wet conditions had made it difficult for them to tend to their crops and the excess moisture made it harder for them to light fires to cook their meals. As a result, the villagers were becoming increasingly reliant on the food that they had stored up from the previous harvest. Despite this, the villagers still maintained a strong sense of community and would often come together to share their food and resources with one another. They knew that in times like these, it was important to support one another and work together to overcome the challenges that the wet conditions had brought upon them.
