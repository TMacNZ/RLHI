The year was 2055, and humanity had finally achieved interstellar travel. However, a critical issue arose during a display of the new technology in Subsaharan Africa. As the crowd gathered to witness the first interstellar jump, a natural disaster struck, causing chaos and destruction. A massive earthquake shook the ground, causing buildings to crumble and roads to split open. As the crowd scattered in panic, the interstellar ship's display malfunctioned, causing a dangerous surge of energy that threatened to engulf the area. The legal ramifications of the disaster were immediate, as the interstellar travel company was held liable for the damages and loss of life. The incident sparked a global debate on the safety and regulation of interstellar travel, with stricter laws being put in place to prevent such disasters from happening again.
