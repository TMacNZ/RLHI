In North Africa, a group of Islamic students have been experiencing an annoying problem while learning about environmental issues online. The online educational materials they are using contain a lack of representation and relevance to the Islamic culture and its relationship with the environment. This has resulted in confusion and disengagement among the students, who are struggling to connect with the content. The students have expressed their frustration to their teachers, who have now raised concerns to the online educational platform. The platform has acknowledged the issue and is working to create more inclusive and culturally relevant materials for their Islamic students in North Africa.
