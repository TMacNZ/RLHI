The parents had contrasting profiles, as the father was a highly successful businessman and the mother was a renowned scientist. They had always respected each other's professions, but their differing intellectual perspectives began to cause irreconcilable conflicts that eventually tore the family apart. The father believed in the power of money and the importance of material possessions, while the mother valued scientific research and the advancement of knowledge.

The children were caught in the middle of this intellectual war and were forced to choose sides, causing them emotional trauma that would affect them for years to come. The family's once happy and united profile was destroyed, leaving them shattered and struggling to pick up the pieces.
