The interstellar voyage was nearing its end as the spacecraft approached the target planet. The crew was eagerly looking forward to landing and beginning their scientific research. However, as they entered the planet's atmosphere, they encountered a severe tropical storm that had formed over the Pacific region. The storm was so intense that it caused the spacecraft to lose control and crash-land on the planet's surface. The impact was so severe that one of the crew members suffered a critical injury to their lap. The legal department was immediately contacted to assess the situation and determine the necessary course of action. The crew was stranded on a foreign planet with limited resources and an injured member, all due to a natural disaster. It was a dire situation that required quick thinking and decisive action to ensure their survival.
