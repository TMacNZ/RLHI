As a philosophy student traveling to North Africa to study ancient texts, I had a clear agenda. But my plans were thrown off course when I was approached by a dangerous individual. He demanded that I hand over my notes and threatened me with a knife. I hesitated, trying to think of a way out of the situation. Suddenly, a group of locals came to my rescue and chased the man away. Shaken, I realized that my philosophical studies had not prepared me for the mundanity of danger in the real world. From that moment on, I had a new perspective on the importance of personal safety and the role of philosophy in shaping our understanding of the world.
