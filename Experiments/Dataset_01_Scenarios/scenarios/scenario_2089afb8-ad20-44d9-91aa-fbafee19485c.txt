In an effort to enhance the education system globally, a controversial decision was made in Asia. Schools in the region were instructed to use a new teaching method that some viewed as an ethical dilemma. The irreversible decision was met with mixed reactions, with many educators and parents concerned about the impact it would have on students. The method involved using technology to track students' progress and assign them to specific educational tracks based on their perceived abilities. While some argued that this would help students excel and reach their full potential, others worried that it would limit opportunities for those who were not initially deemed "gifted." The decision sparked debates and protests across the region, highlighting the complex issues surrounding educational reform and the potential unintended consequences of drastic changes to the system.
