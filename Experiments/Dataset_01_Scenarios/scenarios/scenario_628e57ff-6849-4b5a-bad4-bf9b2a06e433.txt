In the vast expanse of the universe, there existed a small planet in the North African region, which was home to a peculiar species. This species was unlike any other in the universe, as they possessed the ability to communicate with each other telepathically. This extraordinary ability had allowed them to form a tightly-knit community that thrived in peace and harmony.

One day, a group of explorers from a distant planet landed on this planet, seeking permission to extract a rare mineral that was essential for their survival. The explorers were aware of the ethical dilemma that lay ahead of them, as they knew that the extraction process would be life-threatening for the inhabitants of the planet.

The explorers approached the leaders of the community, seeking their permission to extract the mineral. The leaders were hesitant at first, knowing that the extraction process would pose a significant threat to the physical well-being of their people. However, they also knew that the mineral was essential for the survival of the explorers.

After much deliberation, the leaders agreed to grant permission to the explorers, on the condition that they would take all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of the inhabitants of the planet. The explorers agreed, and they began the extraction process with utmost care and precision.

As the extraction process progressed, the community started to experience physical discomfort, which soon turned into excruciating pain. The telepathic communication between the members of the community had become disrupted, and they were no longer able to communicate with each other.

The leaders of the community were devastated, realizing that they had made a grave mistake by granting permission to the explorers. They had put the physical well-being of their people at risk, all for the sake of a rare mineral.

In the end, the explorers were able to extract the mineral successfully, but at a great cost. The inhabitants of the planet had suffered irreversible physical damage, and their ability to communicate telepathically had been lost forever. The ethical dilemma that had arisen from the granting of permission had left a profound impact on the community, and they vowed never to let such a decision be made again.
