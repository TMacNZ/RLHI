In the year 2200, humanity had finally achieved interstellar travel and began exploring the vast expanses of the universe. However, their voyages had unforeseen consequences back on Earth. The wealthy elite had been exploiting the planet's resources for centuries, leaving the environment in a fragile state. When they learned of the discovery of a planet rich in valuable minerals and resources, they immediately sent a fleet of ships to mine it for all it was worth. However, during the mining process, a catastrophic accident occurred, causing a massive explosion that sent shockwaves throughout the galaxy. The shockwaves caused a shift in the Eurasian tectonic plates, triggering a series of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that devastated the region. The toxic gases released by the eruptions poisoned the air and water, causing widespread illness and death. The once-rich Eurasian landscape was now a barren wasteland, unfit for human habitation. The wealthy elite were forced to flee to other planets, leaving the rest of humanity to suffer the consequences of their greed.
