In a remote South Asian village, the night sky was illuminated with a blinding, intergalactic light show. What was once thought to be a rare meteor shower quickly turned into a life-threatening natural disaster as the meteors began to rain down on the village. The cultural significance of the night sky was not lost on the villagers as they watched in horror as their homes and way of life were destroyed. The intergalactic storm was unlike anything they had ever experienced, but they knew they had to act fast to survive. As they scrambled for cover, they prayed for the safety of their loved ones and wondered if they would ever see the stars in the night sky again.
