In Subsaharan Africa, navigating the legal system can be a politically charged endeavor. Even mundane issues can become complicated and contentious when politics are involved. A small business owner seeking to resolve a simple dispute with a supplier may find themselves facing unexpected obstacles due to the political affiliations of the individuals involved. Legal proceedings that should be straightforward can become drawn-out and frustrating affairs. In this environment, it is important to have a clear understanding of the political landscape and to approach legal matters with caution and careful consideration. Failing to do so can result in unwanted complications and setbacks for even the most routine legal matters.
