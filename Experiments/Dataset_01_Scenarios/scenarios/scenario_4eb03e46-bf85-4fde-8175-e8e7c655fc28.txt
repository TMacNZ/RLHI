In South Asia, there is a growing concern that the younger generation ought to be more intellectually engaged in order to address the social challenges that the region is currently facing. The lack of critical thinking skills and intellectual curiosity among the youth is seen as a long-lasting issue that needs to be addressed urgently. Some experts argue that this lack of engagement is a result of the educational system, which prioritizes rote learning over analytical thinking. Others point to the pervasive influence of social media, which tends to promote instant gratification and superficial interactions over deep intellectual engagement. Whatever the cause, the consequences of this trend are serious, as it undermines the ability of society to address complex issues such as poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation. As such, there is a growing consensus that more needs to be done to encourage intellectual curiosity and critical thinking among the younger generation in South Asia, in order to build a more sustainable and equitable future.
