In the mountains of South Asia, a group of international skiers had gathered for a spiritual retreat. They had come from different parts of the world, seeking solace in the serene surroundings and the teachings of their spiritual guru. As part of their retreat, they had planned a skiing expedition on the nearby slopes.

But as they were skiing down the mountain, a critical technological failure occurred. The ski lift that was carrying some of the skiers up the mountain suddenly malfunctioned, and the cable snapped, causing the lift to plummet to the ground. The skiers on board were thrown off the lift and landed on the slope with a thud.

The severity of the situation was immediately apparent. Some of the skiers had suffered critical injuries, while others were trapped under the debris of the lift. Panic set in as the skiers tried to assess the situation and provide help to those who were injured.

As the skiers struggled to cope with the situation, their spiritual guru arrived at the scene. She had been skiing on another slope when she heard about the accident. She immediately took charge of the situation and began to offer spiritual guidance to the injured and the traumatized.

Despite the chaos and confusion, the guru's calming presence brought a sense of peace to the skiers. She led them in a prayer, asking for the well-being of those who were injured and the strength to cope with the situation.

The accident had shaken the skiers to their core, but the guru's teachings gave them the strength to endure. They continued their spiritual retreat, with a newfound appreciation for the fragility of life and the power of spirituality in times of crisis.
