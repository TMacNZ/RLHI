The original nuclear family, consisting of parents and two children, was forced to face the long-lasting aftermath of a devastating natural disaster in the Middle East. A powerful earthquake had struck the region, leaving behind a trail of destruction that affected the physical domain of their lives. The family's home, which they had built themselves, was completely destroyed. They were left with no choice but to seek refuge in a nearby shelter, where hundreds of other families were also seeking safety. The quake had caused severe damage to the region's infrastructure, leaving the family without access to basic necessities such as food, water, and electricity. The parents were struggling to keep their children calm and reassured, but they themselves were grappling with the severity of the situation. It was a challenging and emotional time for the family, as they tried to come to terms with the fact that their lives had been forever changed by a force of nature.
