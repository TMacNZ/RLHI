The online community was left in shock and disbelief when a technological failure led to a major intellectual property breach. Users woke up to find that their personal information, including credit card details, had been compromised and posted online for all to see. The severity of the situation was heightened by the fact that the breach occurred in North America, where privacy laws are strict and violations are taken very seriously. The domain of the breach was intellectual, as the hackers gained access to a database of copyrighted materials. The naked vulnerability of the affected users was palpable, as they struggled to come to terms with the fact that their personal information was now in the hands of strangers.
