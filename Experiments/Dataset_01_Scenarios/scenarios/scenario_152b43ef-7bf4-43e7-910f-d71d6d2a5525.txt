After years of struggling to make ends meet, the Silva family had finally managed to save enough money to hire a lawyer to help them navigate the complex legal system. They had been living in fear for months, ever since political unrest had erupted in their South American country. They were not directly involved in any protests or demonstrations, but they knew that the government was cracking down on dissidents and perceived enemies. The Silvas were a nuclear family, with two young children who were their entire world. They couldn't bear the thought of being forcibly separated or worse, so they had decided to take action before it was too late. With the help of their lawyer, they began the process of applying for asylum in a neighboring country. It was a long and arduous journey, but they knew that it was their only hope for a better life.
