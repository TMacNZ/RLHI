One beautiful morning in the South Pacific, a group of fitness enthusiasts gathered in a park to work out together. As they were warming up, a heated argument broke out between two members of the group. It turned out that one of them had recently converted to a new religion that did not allow physical exercise outside of prayer and meditation, and was now urging others to follow suit. The other members of the group, however, were not willing to give up their fitness routine and felt that their new friend was being too pushy and judgmental. The argument quickly escalated into a shouting match, with accusations flying back and forth. Eventually, the group decided to split up, with some following their new friend on a spiritual journey and others continuing their fitness routine without him. Although the conflict was typical and did not turn violent, it left a sour taste in everyone's mouth and made them question the compatibility of fitness and spirituality.
