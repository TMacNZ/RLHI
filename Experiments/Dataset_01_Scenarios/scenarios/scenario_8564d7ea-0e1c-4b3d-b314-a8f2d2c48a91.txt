In Asia, the political unrest has reached a boiling point. The federal government has been struggling to accomplish peace talks with the opposing party, but to no avail. The disruption caused by the protests has affected the scientific domain as well. Laboratories and research facilities have been forced to shut down due to the violent clashes between the police and the protestors. The government's failure to address the situation has caused a rift between the citizens and the authorities. The international community is watching with concern, as the tension in Asia continues to escalate. The federal government needs to act quickly and find a solution to restore peace and stability before the situation spirals out of control.
