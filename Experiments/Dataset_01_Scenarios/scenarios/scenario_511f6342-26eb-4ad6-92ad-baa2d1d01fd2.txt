The extended family had planned a trip to the Pacific for months. Everyone was excited to spend quality time together and explore the beautiful scenery. They had rented a small craft to go on a day trip to a secluded island. As they were approaching the island, they noticed a group of sea turtles swimming nearby. One of the family members, who was an avid crafter, had brought along some materials to make a souvenir for everyone. She decided to use the turtle shells to craft beautiful necklaces for everyone. However, another family member spoke up and pointed out that it was unethical to use these shells. They were irreversibly harming the turtles' physical domain and could not be replaced. A heated discussion ensued, with half the family arguing that it was just a harmless craft and the other half arguing for the ethical dilemma of using animal parts. The situation caused a rift in the family that would take a long time to heal.
