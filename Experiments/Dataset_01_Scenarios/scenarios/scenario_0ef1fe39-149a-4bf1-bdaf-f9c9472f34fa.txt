In South Asia, a regional campaign has been launched to promote the use of eco-friendly products and reduce plastic waste. However, an ethical dilemma arises when it is discovered that some of the companies sponsoring the campaign are actually contributing to environmental degradation through their manufacturing processes. The severity of the issue is deemed insignificant as the campaign is still in its early stages and has not yet gained significant traction. Nevertheless, there is a concern that promoting these companies may send the wrong message and undermine the campaign's overall mission. The organizers are left with a difficult decision of whether to continue accepting sponsorship from these companies or to risk losing funding and support for the campaign. They must weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks and ultimately determine the best course of action that aligns with their ethical values and commitment to the environment.
