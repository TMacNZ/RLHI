The Johnson family had a mundane issue to deal with - their youngest son's habit of hiding things around the house. It started with small things like toys and books, but soon escalated to important items like keys and wallets. The family tried to talk to him and even scolded him for his behavior, but to no avail. It wasn't until the day the family was running late for an important event and couldn't find their car keys that they realized the severity of the situation. They searched everywhere and were on the verge of canceling their plans when they finally found the keys hidden under a cushion. The family sat down with their son and had a heart-to-heart conversation about why he felt the need to hide things. They discovered that he was feeling neglected and wanted attention. From that day forward, the family made a conscious effort to spend more quality time with him and the hiding habit eventually stopped.
