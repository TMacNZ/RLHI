Carbon monoxide poisoning has become a growing health concern in the small South Pacific village of Tavua. The village's reliance on old and inefficient cooking stoves has led to dangerous levels of carbon monoxide buildup in homes, causing a range of health problems for residents. Those who cook inside their homes are especially at risk, as the poorly ventilated spaces trap carbon monoxide fumes, leading to headaches, nausea, and even unconsciousness. The village council has begun an awareness campaign, educating residents on the dangers of carbon monoxide and encouraging the use of safer cooking methods. However, the cost of new stoves and ventilation systems remains a challenge, leaving many families struggling to balance their health with their limited financial resources.
