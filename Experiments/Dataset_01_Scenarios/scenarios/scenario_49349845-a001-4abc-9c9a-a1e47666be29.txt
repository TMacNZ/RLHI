In the distant future, punishment for breaking cultural norms has been taken to a whole new level. In North America, where the strictest cultural codes are enforced, the punishment for even the slightest deviation can be severe. Those who break the rules are banished to the far corners of the galaxy, forced to live out their lives in isolation on distant planets. The severity of the punishment is meant to serve as a deterrent for those who might consider going against the established norms. However, as the number of banished individuals grows, questions are being raised about the effectiveness and morality of such a punishment. The intergalactic community is watching closely, waiting to see if North America will continue down this path or find a new way to address social challenges.
