The tight economic situation had put a strain on the extended family living in South Asia. Arguments were becoming more frequent as everyone struggled to make ends meet. The disagreement that broke out during the family meeting was a testament to this. Each member had their own opinion on how to handle the financial crisis, but no one seemed to agree. The eldest member of the family, who was the decision-maker, tried to keep the peace, but tensions were running high. Finally, after hours of heated discussion, a compromise was reached. Everyone agreed to chip in and contribute what they could to alleviate the economic pressure. It wasn't a perfect solution, but it was enough to ease the tension and bring some much-needed relief to the family.
