Fatima and Ahmed had been close friends since childhood, but lately, their conversations had been more contentious than usual. The source of their disagreement was politics. Fatima was a fervent supporter of the current government, while Ahmed was an outspoken critic. 

One day, while out for a walk in the bustling streets of Casablanca, their heated discussion reached a boiling point. Fatima accused Ahmed of not understanding the country's complex political landscape, while Ahmed accused Fatima of blindly supporting a corrupt regime. 

Their argument lasted for hours, and their frustration with each other grew with every passing minute. Eventually, Fatima suggested they take a break and grab a bite to eat. Ahmed agreed, and they spent the rest of the afternoon at a nearby caf√©. 

Despite their annoyance with each other, they managed to put their political differences aside and enjoy each other's company. As they sipped mint tea and nibbled on pastries, they reminisced about their childhood and the memories they shared. 

As they walked back home, they both realized that their political disagreements didn't have to define their friendship. They agreed to disagree and promised to spend more time focusing on the things they had in common rather than the things that set them apart.
