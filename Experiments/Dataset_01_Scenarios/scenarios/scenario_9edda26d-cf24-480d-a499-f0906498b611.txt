In Eurasia, political unrest had been brewing for months, and tensions were running high between the government and the people. The latest development came in the form of a technological strip that was installed in every citizen's ID card. This strip was supposed to help with identification and security, but many saw it as an invasion of privacy and a way for the government to monitor their every move. Protests broke out across the country, and people took to the streets to demand that the strips be removed. The government responded with force, and clashes between protesters and police became more and more violent. In the end, the strips remained in place, but the damage had been done, and the relationship between the government and the people was irreparably damaged.
