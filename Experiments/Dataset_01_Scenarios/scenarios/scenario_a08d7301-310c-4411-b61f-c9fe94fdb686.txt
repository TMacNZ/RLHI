As the extended family gathered for dinner, Auntie May couldn't help but tell her story about surviving a massive earthquake in Asia. While her story was undoubtedly fascinating, it had become an annoyance to everyone at the table. They had heard it so many times before, and it was always the same details repeated over and over again. However, the conversation took a serious turn when Uncle John mentioned that his friend's family, who lived in the same region as Auntie May, had lost everything in a recent natural disaster. Suddenly, the mood became somber as they discussed the legal ramifications of such a tragedy. They wondered if the family had insurance or if they could seek legal action against the government for their loss. The dinner ended on a quiet note as everyone contemplated the true impact of natural disasters on people's lives.
