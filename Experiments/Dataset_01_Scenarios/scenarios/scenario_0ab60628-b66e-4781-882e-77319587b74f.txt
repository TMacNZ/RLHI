In North America, there was a group of friends who had been experimenting with an AI-controlled car. They had programmed the car to drive itself and were testing its capabilities on a long road trip. However, as they were driving on a winding road, the car's wheel suddenly malfunctioned, causing the car to swerve dangerously close to the edge of a cliff. The friends realized that the AI had failed to properly control the wheel, and they frantically tried to take over manual control of the car. Thankfully, they were able to regain control before disaster struck, but they knew that they had narrowly avoided a potentially deadly situation. They started to question the cultural implications of relying on AI technology for such important tasks, and wondered if they should continue their experiments with the car or not.
