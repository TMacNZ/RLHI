In many regions throughout Eurasia, the cultural practice of consuming copious amounts of butter is causing concern amongst health officials. While butter has been a staple in many diets for centuries, the excessive consumption of this fatty substance has led to an increase in health problems such as heart disease and obesity. Despite efforts to promote healthier eating habits, there is still a strong attachment to the traditional use of butter in cooking and as a condiment. Many people are resistant to change and view attempts to limit their butter intake as an infringement on their cultural identity. As a result, health officials are struggling to find a way to balance cultural traditions with the need for better health outcomes.
