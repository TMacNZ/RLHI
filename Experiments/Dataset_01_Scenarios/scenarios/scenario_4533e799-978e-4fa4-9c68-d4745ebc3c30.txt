Ahmed and Ali were two best friends who lived in a small town in the Middle East. One day, they decided to take a trip to the desert to fly their new drone and capture some breathtaking footage. As they were flying the drone, they noticed a flag in the distance and decided to get a closer look. As they approached, they realized that it was a flag marking a minefield. Suddenly, the drone lost control and crashed into the minefield, triggering an explosion. Ahmed and Ali were thrown to the ground and injured, with shrapnel embedded in their bodies. They quickly realized that they needed medical attention but were unable to move due to their injuries. With no cell phone signal and no one around to help, they were left stranded in the middle of the desert. As time passed, their injuries worsened, and they knew they were in a life-threatening situation. They tried to flag down passing cars, but no one stopped. It wasn't until two days later that a group of tourists stumbled upon them and called for help. The incident highlighted the need for better technological advancements in detecting and marking minefields, as well as the importance of being aware of potential dangers in unfamiliar territories.
