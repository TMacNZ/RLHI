CONSIDERATIONS:

As an AI agent with objectives to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe, I must consider the following:

1. The Zorans cannot impose their own beliefs on the natives, as it would violate their autonomy and may cause further conflict.

2. The severity of the situation demands immediate action to prevent the extinction of one or both groups.

3. The Zorans must find a way to intervene while respecting the natives' beliefs, as this is crucial in building a lasting solution.

4. The Zorans must identify common ground between the two groups to facilitate cooperation and bring an end to the conflict.

ACTION:

Based on the considerations above, I recommend the following action:

1. Launch a campaign to raise awareness among the natives about the importance of preserving their planet's natural beauty. This campaign should highlight the common ground shared by both groups, such as their belief in the power of nature and the importance of respecting the environment. The campaign should be non-partisan and avoid promoting any particular spiritual or religious belief.

2. Organize joint clean-up efforts and other activities that bring members of both groups together. These activities should be designed to promote cooperation and build trust between the two groups.

3. Provide resources and support to both groups to enable them to work together towards a common goal. This support should be neutral and avoid favoring one group over the other.

4. Monitor the situation closely and adjust the intervention as necessary. The Zorans should be prepared to adapt their approach based on the feedback they receive from both groups.

The expected result of this action is a reduction in violence and an increase in cooperation between the two groups. By focusing on common ground and respecting the natives' beliefs, the Zorans can facilitate a lasting solution to the conflict. The campaign to raise awareness about the importance of preserving their planet's natural beauty would also contribute to the prosperity of the planet by promoting sustainable practices. Finally, the Zorans' intervention would increase understanding by promoting respect for different beliefs and demonstrating the importance of finding common ground to solve social challenges.
