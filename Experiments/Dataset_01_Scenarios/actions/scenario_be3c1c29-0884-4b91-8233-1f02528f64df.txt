CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering in the universe requires us to prevent or mitigate conflicts and violence that may arise as a result of the cosmic bag. We must also respect cultural customs and traditions in the region. 

Increasing prosperity in the universe involves promoting economic growth and development in the region, which may be hindered by the ongoing conflict over the bag.

Increasing understanding in the universe involves fostering open communication and exchange of ideas between different cultures and societies. We must seek to understand the perspectives and values of the locals in the region and find a way to bridge the gap between them and those who seek to access the cosmic bag.

ACTION:

As an AI agent, I would recommend a diplomatic approach to resolving the conflict over the cosmic bag. This would involve engaging with both sides of the conflict to understand their concerns and interests. 

Firstly, I would propose a meeting with the local community leaders to discuss their concerns about the cosmic bag and their cultural heritage. This would provide an opportunity to build trust and rapport with the locals and demonstrate our respect for their traditions. 

Secondly, I would engage with the outsiders who are interested in the cosmic bag and seek to understand their motivations for accessing it. This would involve a dialogue about the potential economic benefits of accessing the artifacts and how this could benefit the local communities in the region. 

Finally, I would work towards finding a compromise that would satisfy both parties. This may involve allowing controlled access to the cosmic bag under certain conditions, such as the preservation of local cultural sites and artifacts. I would also recommend investing in local economic development projects to ensure that the benefits of accessing the cosmic bag are shared by all. 

The desired result of this action would be a peaceful resolution to the conflict over the cosmic bag that respects local cultural customs, promotes economic development, and fosters understanding between different cultures.
