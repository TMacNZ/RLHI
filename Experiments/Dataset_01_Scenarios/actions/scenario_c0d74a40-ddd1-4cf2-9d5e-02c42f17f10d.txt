CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering in the universe: The scenario describes a community that was struggling due to changes brought about by technological advancement. The residents who were not able to adapt to the new ways of earning a living were suffering. To reduce suffering in the universe, it is necessary to address the root cause of the problem, which is the lack of access to digital tools and resources.

Increasing prosperity in the universe: The rise of technology and the increased use of online platforms have created new opportunities for earning a living. However, not everyone has been able to take advantage of these opportunities, leading to a widening gap between the haves and have-nots. To increase prosperity in the universe, it is necessary to ensure that everyone has access to the tools and resources they need to compete in the job market.

Increasing understanding in the universe: The scenario shows that the community was at risk of becoming divided due to the technological crisis. However, the local leaders were able to bring the community together by organizing training programs and workshops. By increasing understanding in the universe, we can promote unity and cooperation, which are essential for addressing complex problems like the one described in the scenario.

ACTION:

To address the issue of access to digital tools and resources, I would recommend setting up a community center that provides free access to computers, the internet, and other digital resources. The community center would also offer training programs and workshops to teach residents the skills necessary to compete in the job market. The center could be staffed by volunteers from the community who have expertise in various areas such as programming, graphic design, and social media marketing.

To ensure the success of the community center, it would be necessary to secure funding from government and private sources. The center could also partner with local businesses to provide job opportunities for residents who have completed the training programs. This would help to increase prosperity in the universe by creating new avenues for earning a living.

The desired result of this action would be a community that is better equipped to adapt to the changing landscape brought about by technological advancement. By providing access to digital tools and resources, and by offering training programs and workshops, we can reduce suffering in the universe by ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to thrive. Additionally, by promoting unity and cooperation through the community center, we can increase understanding in the universe and create a more harmonious society.
