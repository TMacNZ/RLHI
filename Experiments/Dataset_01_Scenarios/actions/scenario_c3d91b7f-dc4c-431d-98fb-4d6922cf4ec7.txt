CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering: Lack of access to education can lead to a cycle of poverty and suffering. By providing shoes and educational materials to children who need them, we can help break this cycle and give them a chance to succeed.

Increasing prosperity: Education is a key factor in increasing prosperity. By providing access to education, we can help children develop the skills and knowledge they need to improve their lives and contribute to their communities.

Increasing understanding: By promoting education, we can help increase understanding and awareness of the importance of education in Subsaharan Africa. This can lead to more support for education initiatives and policies that can help improve access to education for more children.
