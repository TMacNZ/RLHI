CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, there are several considerations to be made in this scenario. 

Firstly, bribery and corruption are detrimental to the well-being and prosperity of a society. They undermine trust in the government, discourage foreign investment, and ultimately harm the economy. 

Secondly, upholding ethical standards is crucial in building a fair and just society. It is the responsibility of everyone, including political consultants, to ensure that their actions align with ethical principles. 

Thirdly, it is important to consider the potential consequences of taking action against a client. In certain situations, confronting a client could lead to negative consequences such as losing their business, damaging one's reputation, or even physical harm. 

ACTION:
Given the considerations, the best course of action for the political consultant in this scenario is to confront the client about their corrupt practices. 

The consultant should explain to the client the negative consequences of bribery and corruption, and how it undermines the trust in the government. They should also highlight the importance of upholding ethical standards, especially for a government official who is expected to set an example for the people. 

It is important to approach the situation with diplomacy and tact, as the client may be resistant to change. The consultant should also be prepared to provide alternative strategies for winning the election, such as focusing on policy and campaign promises rather than resorting to illegal means. 

The desired result of this action is for the client to stop their corrupt practices and win the election through legal means. This would not only uphold ethical standards, but also contribute to the prosperity and understanding of the society.
