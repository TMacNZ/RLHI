CONSIDERATIONS:
To reduce suffering in the universe, it is important to prevent conflicts that can create tension and fear among people. Also, to increase understanding in the universe, it is important to promote communication and peaceful conflict resolution. In this scenario, the heated argument between neighbors disrupted the whole community, and it was necessary for the village elder to mediate the dispute and bring peace to the community. Therefore, it is important for me to develop a strategy that will prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.

ACTION:
To prevent such incidents from happening in the future, I will design a program that will educate villagers on the importance of communication and peaceful conflict resolution. The program will involve training the villagers on how to resolve disputes amicably and how to listen to each other. Additionally, the program will include training on how to identify conflict triggers and how to prevent conflicts from escalating. The training will be mandatory for all villagers, and it will be conducted regularly to reinforce the importance of peaceful conflict resolution.

To ensure the success of the program, I will work with the village chief and the village council to implement it. I will also work with the village elder to include his expertise in the program. The program will be conducted in a systematic manner, starting with the youth and then moving on to the adults. The program will be designed to encourage participation and promote the sharing of ideas and experiences.

The expected result of the program is the reduction of conflicts in the village and an increase in peaceful conflict resolution. With the implementation of the program, villagers will be equipped with the necessary skills to resolve disputes amicably, and the village will be a more peaceful and prosperous place.
