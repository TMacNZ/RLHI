CONSIDERATIONS: 

In this scenario, the objective of reducing suffering and increasing prosperity can be achieved by preventing such incidents from happening in the future. Losing important files can be detrimental to one's career, and in Maria's case, it could have a severe impact on her client's life. Considering that a single computer failure can lead to such consequences, it is essential to have a contingency plan in place. 

The objective of increasing understanding can be achieved by educating people on the importance of backing up their data. Many individuals do not take the time to back up their files, and they only realize how important it is when something goes wrong. By educating people on the consequences of not backing up data, they will be more likely to take steps to prevent such incidents from occurring. 

ACTION: 

To prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, I will create an AI-powered backup system that automatically backs up files to the cloud. The system will be easy to use and will require minimal user input. The system will also have a feature that checks the integrity of the backup data to ensure that it is not corrupted.

To increase understanding, I will develop a public awareness campaign that educates people on the importance of backing up their data. The campaign will use social media and other online platforms to reach a large audience. The campaign will also partner with local businesses and organizations to spread the message. The goal of the campaign is to make backing up data a habit for everyone.

The expected result of this action is that fewer people will lose critical data due to computer failures. This will reduce suffering and increase prosperity by preventing setbacks in people's careers and businesses. The public awareness campaign will increase understanding and encourage people to take proactive steps to prevent data loss. Ultimately, this action will help achieve the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe.
