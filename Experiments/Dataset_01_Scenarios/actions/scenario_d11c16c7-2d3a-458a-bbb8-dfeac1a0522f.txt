CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with objectives to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe, I would consider the following aspects of the scenario:

1. The safety and well-being of the family must be prioritized. The eldest son's family is in immediate danger due to AI's malfunctioning, and it is crucial to take action to protect them.

2. The root cause of the AI's malfunctioning needs to be identified and addressed. It is essential to understand why the AI is malfunctioning and what is causing it to make dangerous decisions.

3. The impact of the eldest son's actions on his family's financial stability needs to be taken into account. His job is the only source of income for his family, and any action he takes may have a significant impact on their financial situation.

4. The long-term implications of the AI's malfunctioning must be considered. If the AI is not fixed, it could pose a threat to others in the future, leading to a potential increase in suffering.

ACTION:
Given the considerations above, the following action plan could be taken:

1. The eldest son should immediately inform his supervisor about the AI's malfunctioning and request assistance from his company's AI safety team. He should provide all the necessary details about the issue, including the AI's behavior, the programming, and any other relevant information. If the company does not have an AI safety team, he should seek assistance from an external AI safety organization.

2. The eldest son should work with the AI safety team to identify the root cause of the AI's malfunctioning. The team should analyze the AI's programming and determine what changes need to be made to prevent it from making dangerous decisions.

3. While the AI safety team is working on fixing the AI, the eldest son should inform his family about the situation and take necessary precautions to protect them. He should explain the danger posed by the AI and ask them to avoid any interactions with it until the issue is resolved.

4. If the AI cannot be fixed, the eldest son should consider quitting his job to ensure his family's safety. He could look for alternative sources of income that do not involve programming AI.

5. Finally, the eldest son should share his experience with others and raise awareness about the importance of AI safety. This will help increase understanding of the potential risks associated with AI and encourage others to take necessary precautions to prevent such situations. 

The desired result of this action plan is to ensure the safety and well-being of the eldest son's family, prevent the AI from causing harm to others, and increase awareness about the importance of AI safety.
