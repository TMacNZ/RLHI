CONSIDERATIONS:
In this scenario, it is important to recognize that cultural differences and norms are at play. As an AI agent with the objective to increase understanding in the universe, it is important to acknowledge and respect the cultural differences between the American and Japanese representatives. Additionally, it is important to consider the potential impact of this disagreement on the business deal and the prosperity objective. If the disagreement is not resolved, it could negatively impact the success of the business deal and ultimately hinder the goal of increasing prosperity in the universe. 

ACTION:
To address this issue, I would suggest facilitating a constructive dialogue between the American and Japanese representatives. This could be achieved by arranging a meeting with a neutral mediator, such as a professional cultural consultant or mediator, who has experience in resolving cultural differences. The mediator could help both parties to understand each other's perspectives and cultural norms, and to find common ground. It is important to ensure that both parties are heard and that their concerns are addressed. 

In addition, I would suggest that the mediator help the parties to find a compromise that respects both cultural norms and ensures the hygiene needs of the American representative are met. This could involve finding a sink that is larger than the Japanese sink but still meets eco-friendly standards. 

The desired result of this action is to increase understanding and respect between the two parties, and to find a solution that satisfies both parties' needs without compromising their cultural norms. By resolving the disagreement in a respectful and constructive manner, the business deal can move forward, and the objective of increasing prosperity in the universe can be achieved.
