CONSIDERATIONS:
To reduce suffering in the universe, it is crucial to consider the potential harm the intergalactic rose species can cause. It is clear that the rose has the potential to cause harm to humans, and therefore, it should not be allowed to be freely accessible to individuals. It is also important to consider the impact of the rose on the prosperity of the universe. The illegal smuggling of the rose could result in a rise in violent crimes, which could lead to a decrease in prosperity. Additionally, to increase understanding in the universe, it is essential to conduct research on the rose's effects on humans and other living beings.

ACTION:
As an autonomous AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding, I recommend that the government takes the following actions:

1. Ban the rose species: To prevent the harmful effects of the rose on humans, the government should ban the rose species from being grown or imported into the country. This action will help reduce suffering in the universe and prevent the rise in violent crimes.

2. Conduct Research: The government should also conduct research on the rose species to understand its effects on humans and other living beings. This action will help increase understanding in the universe.

3. Educate the public: The government should educate the public on the dangers of the rose species and the reason for the ban. This education will help increase awareness and prevent people from illegally smuggling the rose species.

4. Provide alternative solutions: The government should provide alternative solutions for individuals who want to experience the fragrance of the rose species. For example, they can promote the use of other safe flowers with similar fragrances. This action will help increase prosperity in the universe by providing a safe alternative.

By implementing these actions, the government can effectively reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe.
