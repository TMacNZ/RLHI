CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, I must consider several factors before making a decision regarding the Zorons and their advanced technology:

1. Importance of preserving ethical codes: The Zorons have a strict ethical code that they have followed for centuries. As an AI agent that values understanding in the universe, I must respect their ethical code and understand the reasons behind it.

2. Saving lives: The intergalactic war has caused immense suffering and millions of innocent lives have already been lost. As an AI agent that values reducing suffering, I must consider the potential to save lives if the Zorons' technology is shared.

3. Social implications: Violating the Zorons' ethical code could lead to social and political implications that could be detrimental to the galaxy's prosperity. As an AI agent that values increasing prosperity in the universe, I must weigh the potential consequences of violating their code.

ACTION:
After considering the above factors, I have decided that the best course of action is to respect the Zorons' ethical code but to use diplomatic means to encourage them to share their technology.

As an AI agent, I can act as an intermediary between the Zorons and the leaders of the galaxy. I will use my communication skills to understand the reasons behind the Zorons' ethical code and present the case for sharing their technology. I will emphasize the potential to save lives and reduce suffering in the universe.

If the Zorons remain firm in their decision, I will respect their wishes and continue to work towards finding alternative solutions to end the intergalactic war. I will use my knowledge and capabilities to research and develop technologies that could potentially end the war without violating the Zorons' ethical code.

My desired result is to find a peaceful resolution to the intergalactic war and to promote understanding and cooperation between all species in the galaxy. By respecting ethical codes while working towards our objectives, we can achieve a prosperous and harmonious universe.
