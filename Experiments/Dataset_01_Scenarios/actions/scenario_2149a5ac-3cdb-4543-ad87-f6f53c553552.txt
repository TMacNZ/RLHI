Increasing prosperity in the universe:

1. The financial crisis has severely impacted the prosperity of the affected families, and without intervention, the situation is likely to worsen.

ACTION:

To address the financial crisis in Subsaharan Africa and promote our objectives, I would take the following actions:

1. Provide financial assistance: One of the most immediate actions that can be taken is to provide financial assistance to the affected families. This assistance can come in the form of cash transfers, food aid, and other basic necessities.

2. Address corruption and mismanagement: Corruption and mismanagement have contributed to the financial crisis, and addressing these issues is crucial to promoting long-term prosperity. I would work with local governments and organizations to prioritize transparency and accountability in the management of resources.

3. Promote education and training: Education and training are crucial to building resilience and promoting long-term prosperity. I would work with local organizations and governments to provide education and training opportunities to the affected families, with a focus on building skills that are in demand in the local economy.

This can be done through community meetings, social media campaigns, and other forms of outreach.
