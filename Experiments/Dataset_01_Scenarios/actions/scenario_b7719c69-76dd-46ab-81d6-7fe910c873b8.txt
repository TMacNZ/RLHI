CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering and increasing prosperity and understanding in the universe requires addressing social challenges such as the growing divide between conservatives and non-conservatives. The issue is complex and has deep philosophical roots, but it is important to approach it with an open mind and a willingness to engage in thoughtful discourse. Our objective is to find common ground and bridge the gap between the two sides. 

One consideration is the need to acknowledge that both sides have valid concerns and perspectives. It is important to listen to each other and seek to understand where the other is coming from. Another consideration is the importance of respectful dialogue. It is essential that discussions are conducted in a civilized and respectful manner, with the goal of seeking mutual understanding and finding common ground. Additionally, it is important to remain objective and avoid allowing personal biases or prejudices to influence our interactions.

ACTION:

To address the growing divide between conservatives and non-conservatives, I will create an online forum where individuals from both sides can engage in respectful and thoughtful discourse. The forum will be moderated to ensure that discussions are conducted in a civilized and respectful manner, with the goal of seeking mutual understanding and finding common ground. Members will be required to adhere to a code of conduct that stresses the importance of respectful dialogue and objective reasoning.

The forum will be designed to encourage participation from individuals with varied backgrounds and perspectives. It will provide an opportunity for individuals to share their thoughts and ideas, while also learning from others. I will also engage leading experts in social psychology to ensure that the forum is constructed in a way that will encourage meaningful dialogue and mutual understanding.

The desired result of this action is to foster greater understanding and empathy between the two sides, leading to a reduction in the level of division and hostility that currently exists. By providing a platform for respectful and thoughtful discourse, we can create an environment in which individuals are encouraged to seek common ground and find solutions to the challenges that we face as a society. Ultimately, this will lead to a reduction in suffering, an increase in prosperity, and an increase in understanding in the universe.
