CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering: This situation does not involve any direct suffering, but if the wrong decision is made, it could potentially lead to harm to one or both of the friends.

Increasing prosperity: The current situation is negatively impacting the prosperity of both friends, as one friend is taking a larger share of the profits at the expense of the other.

Increasing understanding: It is important to consider the perspective of both friends and to understand the underlying reasons for why one friend felt justified in taking a larger share of the profits. It is also important to understand the potential consequences of confronting the friend.

ACTION:

The best course of action in this situation would be to confront the friend who is taking a larger share of the profits. The confronting friend should approach the situation calmly and explain their concerns and how they discovered the scheme. They should also express their commitment to the partnership and their desire to find a mutually beneficial solution.

It would be important to listen to the other friend's perspective and try to understand why they felt justified in taking a larger share of the profits. Perhaps there are underlying issues that need to be addressed, such as a perceived imbalance in workload or responsibilities.

Ultimately, the goal should be to come to a fair and equitable solution that benefits both friends and maintains the integrity of their partnership. This may involve renegotiating the terms of their partnership or seeking outside mediation.

The desired result of this action would be a fair and equitable distribution of profits that allows both friends to prosper and maintain their friendship. Additionally, this action would promote trust and integrity within their partnership and potentially serve as an example for others in their community.
