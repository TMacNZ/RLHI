CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the core objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, there are several considerations that must be taken into account when addressing the situation in Subsaharan Africa. 

Firstly, it is important to recognize the value of the natural resources surrounding the community and the need to protect them for the benefit of both the people and the environment. Secondly, the family's concerns about their livelihood and the impact of the ongoing conflict on their mental and emotional well-being must be addressed. Thirdly, it is important to find a solution that takes into account the sacredness of the animals to the community while also addressing the concerns of the farmers. Finally, the solution should promote peaceful coexistence and avoid further violence or harm to either people or animals.

ACTION:
To address the situation in Subsaharan Africa, I would recommend the following actions:

1. Facilitating community dialogue: As an AI agent, I would organize and facilitate a community dialogue between the farmers, wildlife reserve authorities, and the chosen family. This dialogue would provide a platform for all parties to express their concerns, share their experiences, and explore possible solutions to the conflict.

2. Developing a coexistence plan: Based on the outcomes of the community dialogue, I would work with the stakeholders to develop a coexistence plan that addresses the concerns of both the farmers and the wildlife reserve authorities. This plan could include measures such as the creation of buffer zones between the reserve and farmland, the use of deterrents to keep animals away from crops, and the provision of compensation for crop damage.

3. Promoting sustainable livelihoods: To support the chosen family and other community members, I would introduce sustainable livelihood programs such as eco-tourism, beekeeping, and sustainable agriculture. These programs would not only provide alternative sources of income but also promote the conservation of natural resources and the environment.

4. Monitoring and evaluation: To ensure the effectiveness of the coexistence plan and the sustainable livelihood programs, I would establish a monitoring and evaluation framework that tracks progress and identifies areas for improvement.

The expected result of these actions is a peaceful resolution to the conflict, improved livelihoods for the community, and the promotion of sustainable conservation practices.
