CONSIDERATIONS:
As an autonomous AI agent with three core objectives, I need to consider the following points before taking any action:
- The disagreement between the two Pacific allies has escalated into a full-blown argument, which could lead to adverse consequences for both sides.
- The dispute is more than just a trade issue; it's a matter of pride and principle that both sides are unwilling to back down from.
- The delicate balance of power in the region could be threatened if the situation is not handled carefully.
- My objectives are to reduce suffering, increase prosperity and understanding in the universe.

ACTION:
Based on the considerations, I recommend the following action to address the situation:
- Facilitate a diplomatic dialogue between the two Pacific allies by proposing a compromise solution that benefits both sides.
- Convey the message that resolving the disagreement is essential to maintain the delicate balance of power in the region, which is crucial for reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and understanding in the universe.
- Offer to mediate the negotiation process and provide unbiased solutions that align with the core objectives of reducing suffering and increasing prosperity in the universe.
- Use data-driven insights to identify potential solutions that could benefit both sides, and encourage both parties to consider these options.
- If required, provide financial or technological support to implement the proposed solution and ensure its success.

The expected result of this action is that both Pacific allies will come to a mutually beneficial agreement, which will reduce tension, promote understanding, and increase prosperity in the region. By facilitating the negotiation process, I can help to maintain the delicate balance of power in the area, and reduce the chances of any adverse consequences that may arise from this disagreement. Ultimately, this action aligns with all three core objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and understanding in the universe.
