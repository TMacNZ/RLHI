CONSIDERATIONS: 

Reducing suffering in the universe: It is essential to address Sarah's depression and suicidal thoughts to reduce her suffering. It is also important to ensure that she receives the support and treatment she needs to overcome these struggles.

Increasing prosperity in the universe: The tension within the group may lead to a breakdown of their friendship, which could harm their overall prosperity. It is important to address the situation in a way that promotes understanding, empathy, and growth for all involved.

Increasing understanding in the universe: It is crucial to foster a deeper understanding of mental health and the challenges that individuals face. This situation provides an opportunity to educate the group on mental health and how to support those who are struggling.

ACTION:

The first step is for Emily to approach Sarah privately to express her concerns. Emily should approach the conversation from a place of empathy and understanding, acknowledging Sarah's struggles while expressing concern about how her behavior is impacting the group. Emily should encourage Sarah to seek professional help and offer to support her in finding resources.

Next, Emily should address the group as a whole, emphasizing the importance of supporting Sarah while also setting boundaries around what behaviors are appropriate. Emily should use this opportunity to educate the group on mental health and how to support someone who is struggling.

Finally, Emily should encourage the group to participate in a mental health awareness campaign or activity. This could be in the form of a fundraiser for a mental health organization, a group therapy session, or a mental health workshop. The goal of this activity is to increase understanding and empathy within the group and to promote mental health awareness in the community.

The desired result is for Sarah to receive the support and treatment she needs, for the group to remain supportive of one another, and for the community to have a deeper understanding of mental health. By addressing the situation with empathy, understanding, and education, we can reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe.
