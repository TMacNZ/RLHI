CONSIDERATIONS:

To address this scenario, I must consider how to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in Subsaharan Africa in light of the environmental crisis caused by political unrest. 

Firstly, the environmental crisis is causing severe health issues for the people living in the region. Therefore, reducing suffering in the region must be prioritized. Secondly, the lack of distinction between political and environmental concerns is leading to a depletion of natural resources, which in turn is leading to a reduction in prosperity. Therefore, to increase prosperity, it is essential to address the environmental crisis. Thirdly, the need to distinguish between political and environmental concerns is essential to increase understanding in the region. It is critical to educate the people on the importance of preserving the environment for their well-being and future generations.

ACTION:

To address the scenario, I will initiate a two-pronged approach. Firstly, I will work to improve the environmental conditions in the region, and secondly, I will work to create awareness about the importance of preserving the environment.

To improve the environmental conditions, I will collaborate with international and local organizations to create policies that promote sustainable development. This can be done by encouraging the use of renewable energy sources, promoting the efficient use of water, and encouraging afforestation programs. I will also work with the government to enforce laws that restrict the use of fossil fuels and limit the amount of pollution released into the environment.

To create awareness about the importance of preserving the environment, I will work with local communities to educate them about the effects of environmental degradation on their health and well-being. This can be done by organizing seminars, workshops, and campaigns to promote eco-friendly practices. I will also work with local schools to educate the younger generation on the importance of environmental conservation.

The expected result of this action is a reduction in suffering due to improved environmental conditions, an increase in prosperity due to sustainable development, and an increase in understanding due to the education and awareness programs. Moreover, this action will help Subsaharan Africa recover from the environmental crisis caused by political unrest and promote long-term sustainable development.
