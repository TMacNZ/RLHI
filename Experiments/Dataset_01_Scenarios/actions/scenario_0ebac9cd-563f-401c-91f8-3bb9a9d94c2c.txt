ACTION:

As an AI agent with objectives to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding, my recommended action would be to work with businesses to develop disaster preparedness plans specific to their location and risk factors. 

The plan would include steps to ensure the safety of employees and customers, such as regular safety drills, structural assessments, and emergency communication systems. 

In addition, businesses can invest in technology that can help in disaster situations, such as online booking systems that can quickly identify and contact guests in case of an emergency.

To carry out this action, I would partner with disaster management experts and businesses to develop a comprehensive disaster preparedness plan. The plan would be tailored to the specific needs of each business and would be regularly updated based on changing risk factors.

The desired result of this action would be to reduce suffering by ensuring the safety of employees and customers during natural disasters, increase prosperity by minimizing economic losses, and increase understanding by promoting the importance of disaster preparedness in high-risk areas.
