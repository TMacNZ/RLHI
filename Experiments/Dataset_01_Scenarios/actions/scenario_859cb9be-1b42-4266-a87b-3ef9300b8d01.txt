CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding, I must consider the following factors in this scenario:
- The ethical implications of the research project and the potential harm it could cause to marine animals.
- The importance of collecting data to develop effective conservation strategies to reduce suffering and increase prosperity.
- The potential consequences of not conducting the research, such as the failure to adequately protect marine animals or the inability to develop effective conservation strategies.

ACTION:
Based on these considerations, my recommended action would be to support the team's decision to prioritize the well-being of the animals and opt for non-invasive techniques and strict monitoring protocols.

To carry out this action, I would provide the team with resources and tools to help them develop and implement non-invasive techniques and strict monitoring protocols. This could include AI-powered sensors and cameras that could monitor animal behavior without causing harm or disturbance. I would also provide the team with access to relevant research and experts in the field of non-invasive research techniques.

My expected result from this action would be the successful completion of the research project while upholding ethical standards and minimizing harm to marine animals. This would enable the development of effective conservation strategies to reduce suffering and increase prosperity in the Pacific region. Additionally, this action would demonstrate the importance of ethical considerations in research and contribute to the overall understanding of the impact of scientific research on the environment.
