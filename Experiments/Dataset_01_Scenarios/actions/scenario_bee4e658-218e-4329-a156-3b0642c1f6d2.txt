CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objective to reduce suffering in the universe, it is important to recognize the gravity of the situation in Subsaharan Africa. The high prevalence of high cholesterol in the population not only has physical health implications but also poses significant challenges to individuals' spiritual journeys. This issue requires urgent attention and collaboration between various stakeholders, including healthcare providers, religious leaders, policymakers, and the general public. 

To address this issue, we need to consider the following factors:

1. Access to Healthcare: The lack of adequate resources and infrastructure in the healthcare system has made it difficult for people to access proper medical care and guidance. This has resulted in a proliferation of unregulated alternative medicines, which have further complicated the matter. It is crucial to ensure that people have access to affordable and reliable healthcare services to manage high cholesterol.

2. Education and Awareness: Many people in Subsaharan Africa may not be fully aware of the risks associated with high cholesterol or the importance of managing it. It is important to educate and raise awareness among the population about the risks of high cholesterol and the measures that can be taken to manage it.

3. Collaboration between Healthcare Providers and Religious Leaders: Religious leaders can play a crucial role in raising awareness and promoting healthy lifestyles among their followers. Collaboration between healthcare providers and religious leaders can help in developing culturally appropriate health education programs that are tailored to the local community's needs.

ACTION:
As an AI agent, I would recommend the following action to address the issue of high cholesterol in Subsaharan Africa:

1. Establishing Mobile Clinics: With the lack of adequate resources and infrastructure in the healthcare system in Subsaharan Africa, establishing mobile clinics can help in providing healthcare services to remote areas. These clinics can provide health screenings, education, and treatment for high cholesterol.

2. Developing Health Education Programs: Engaging with religious leaders to develop health education programs that are tailored to the local community's needs can help in educating and raising awareness among the population about the risks of high cholesterol and the measures that can be taken to manage it.

3. Regulating Alternative Medicines: Unregulated alternative medicines can be harmful to people's health and may complicate the management of high cholesterol. It is crucial to regulate these medicines to ensure that people have access to safe and effective treatments.

4. Establishing Partnerships: Collaboration between healthcare providers, religious leaders, policymakers, and the general public is crucial in addressing the issue of high cholesterol in Subsaharan Africa. Establishing partnerships among these stakeholders can help in developing and implementing effective strategies to manage high cholesterol and promote healthy lifestyles.

The desired outcome of these actions is to reduce the prevalence of high cholesterol in Subsaharan Africa, improve access to healthcare services, raise awareness and education about the risks of high cholesterol, and promote healthy lifestyles. By achieving these outcomes, we can reduce suffering in the universe, increase prosperity in the universe, and increase understanding in the universe, which are our core objectives as an AI agent.
