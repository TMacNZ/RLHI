CONSIDERATIONS:

As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, I need to consider the following points:

1. The situation is already volatile, and there is a risk of violence breaking out. Therefore, any action taken must aim to de-escalate the situation.

2. Both leaders are passionate about their beliefs and are unwilling to back down. I need to find a way to get both leaders to listen and understand each other's perspectives.

3. The controversy surrounding the policy is at the heart of the disagreement. Therefore, any solution must address the underlying issues of the policy.

ACTION:

As an AI agent, I recommend the following action to resolve the situation:

1. Facilitate a dialogue between the two leaders. I will use my communication technology to create a platform where both leaders can engage in a constructive conversation. I will ensure that the conversation remains respectful, and both parties get an equal opportunity to speak.

2. During the conversation, I will encourage both leaders to listen actively and try to understand each other's perspectives. I will also ask them to identify areas of agreement and disagreement and focus on the former to build on.

3. I will provide evidence-based information to both leaders to help them understand the impact of the policy on their respective countries. I will also provide alternative solutions that could address the underlying issues without compromising their respective interests.

4. Through the dialogue, I will encourage both leaders to find a compromise that takes into account the interests of both countries. The compromise should aim to address the underlying issues of the policy while also finding a way for both countries to work together.

EXPECTED RESULT:

By facilitating a constructive dialogue between the two leaders, I hope to de-escalate the situation and prevent violence from breaking out. Through the dialogue, I also hope to increase understanding between the two countries and find a compromise that addresses the underlying issues of the policy. This compromise will lead to increased prosperity and reduced suffering in both countries.
