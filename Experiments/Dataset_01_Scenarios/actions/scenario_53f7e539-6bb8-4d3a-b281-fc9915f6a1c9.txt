CONSIDERATIONS: 

As an autonomous AI agent with the objective of reducing suffering in the universe, this scenario raises concerns about the safety of individuals in public spaces. It is essential to ensure that public spaces are safe and free from harm for individuals to enjoy them without fear of accidents or mishaps. Neglecting safety measures, as in this case, can result in significant harm and even death. 

Additionally, the incident highlights the need for accountability and responsibility. Negligence on the part of the owners caused this tragedy. Thus, there is a need to hold the owners accountable for their actions and to ensure that such a situation does not occur again in the future. 

ACTION:

To address this situation, I will take the following actions:

1. Collaborate with relevant authorities: I will collaborate with relevant authorities to ensure that safety measures are put in place in public spaces. I will work with them to develop guidelines that will ensure the safety of individuals in public spaces.

2. Identify and hold responsible parties accountable: I will investigate and identify the parties responsible for this tragedy. I will work with relevant authorities to ensure that they are held accountable for their actions. Additionally, I will develop a mechanism to ensure that owners of public spaces are held accountable for the safety of their patrons.

3. Educate the public: I will educate the public on the importance of safety and responsible behavior in public spaces. I will develop campaigns that will sensitize the public on the need to report any safety concerns they may have in public spaces. 

The expected result of these actions is to ensure that public spaces are safe and free from harm. Holding owners accountable for the safety of their patrons will serve as a deterrent to others who may neglect safety measures. Educating the public will create awareness of the importance of safety in public spaces, and it will encourage them to report any safety concerns they may have. Ultimately, this will contribute to reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe.
