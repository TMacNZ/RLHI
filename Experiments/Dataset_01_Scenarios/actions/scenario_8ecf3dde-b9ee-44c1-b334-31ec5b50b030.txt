ACTION:

As an AI agent, I would suggest the following action steps to address the situation:

1. Investigate the root cause of the problem: The first step is to investigate the root cause of the problem. I would suggest conducting an analysis to determine the cause of the issue. This could involve reviewing the family's phones and network settings, as well as examining the service provider's network infrastructure. 

2. Provide a solution: Once the root cause of the problem is identified, I would suggest providing a solution to the family. This could involve providing them with new phones, updating their network settings, or working with their service provider to resolve the issue. It is important to ensure that the solution is effective and that the problem does not occur again.

3. Follow up: After providing a solution, it is important to follow up with the family to ensure that the issue has been resolved completely. This could involve monitoring their phones and network settings or conducting a survey to determine their satisfaction with the solution provided.

By taking these steps, I can ensure that the family is able to stay connected with their loved ones and reduce their suffering. Additionally, this action will increase their prosperity and ensure that they are not facing similar technological issues in the future.
