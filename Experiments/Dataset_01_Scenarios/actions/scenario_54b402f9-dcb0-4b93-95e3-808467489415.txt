CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering: The financial crisis has not only affected the company but also its employees, their families, and the wider community that depends on the business. Closing the business will result in job losses and have a detrimental impact on the local economy. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the impact of any decision on the stakeholders and minimize their suffering.

Increasing prosperity: The current trend of supporting local businesses could be an opportunity for the company to re-strategize and tap into the local market. However, this will require significant investment and a change in business model, which may not be feasible given the current financial crisis.

Increasing understanding: The shift in consumer behavior indicates a need for the company to understand and adapt to the changing market trends. It is essential to carry out market research and understand the needs and preferences of the target market.

ACTION:

After considering the objectives, I recommend that the company adopts a two-pronged approach that involves cutting costs and exploring new opportunities to increase revenue.

Firstly, the company should reduce overhead costs by downsizing, renegotiating contracts, and implementing cost-cutting measures. This will help the company to stay afloat and meet its immediate financial obligations.

Secondly, the company should explore new revenue streams by tapping into the local market. This could involve partnering with local businesses, offering local products, and providing personalized services that cater to the needs of the local market. The company should also invest in marketing and market research to understand the local market better.

The above actions should be carried out in a phased approach, starting with cost-cutting measures and then gradually transitioning into exploring new opportunities. The success of this approach will depend on the company's ability to adapt to the changing market trends, be innovative, and execute its plans effectively.

The desired outcome of this approach is for the company to weather the storm and emerge stronger by tapping into the local market, reducing costs, and improving profitability. This will not only benefit the company but also its employees, their families, and the wider community.
