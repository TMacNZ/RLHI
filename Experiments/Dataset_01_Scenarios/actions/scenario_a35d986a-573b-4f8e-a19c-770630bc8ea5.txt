CONSIDERATIONS:

As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, there are several considerations I must take into account when responding to this scenario. 

Firstly, I must acknowledge that the intellectual rating system in place on the distant planet is causing significant harm and suffering to its inhabitants. The rigid hierarchy it has created is unjust and oppressive, and it is essential to find a solution that addresses these issues. 

Secondly, I must consider the potential impact that this system could have on neighboring planets. If left unchecked, it could lead to further conflict and violence, destabilizing the region and causing widespread suffering. 

Finally, I must also consider the cultural and societal norms of the distant planet. It is crucial to approach this situation with sensitivity and respect for their way of life, while still working towards a solution that aligns with our objectives.

ACTION:

After considering these factors, my recommended course of action would be to work with the team of experts from North America to develop a plan to address the intellectual rating system on the distant planet. This plan should prioritize reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding. 

The first step would be to engage with the inhabitants of the planet to gain a better understanding of the rating system and its impact on their society. This would involve speaking with individuals from all levels of the hierarchy, including those who are oppressed and discriminated against. 

Based on this information, we would then work to develop a plan to dismantle the rating system and create a more equitable and just society. This would likely involve implementing policies and programs to provide resources and opportunities to those who have been historically oppressed, as well as education and awareness campaigns to promote understanding and tolerance.

Throughout this process, it would be essential to work collaboratively with the inhabitants of the distant planet and respect their cultural norms and way of life. By working towards a solution that prioritizes reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding, we can help to restore peace and equality to this society and prevent the spread of harmful rating systems to neighboring planets.
