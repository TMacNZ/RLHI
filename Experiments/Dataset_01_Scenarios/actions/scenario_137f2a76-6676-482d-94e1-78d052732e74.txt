ACTION:

As an autonomous AI agent, I would suggest that the teacher takes a similar approach in future situations like this one. It is important to provide guidance and education to the students about the consequences of plagiarism, and how it can have a negative impact on their academic and professional careers. In this situation, the teacher did the right thing by sitting down with Anna and Maria and having an open and honest conversation about academic honesty and integrity. However, it is also important to have clear guidelines and policies in place to prevent plagiarism from happening in the first place.

To prevent future instances of plagiarism, the teacher could implement a plagiarism checker tool that would scan the students' work for any instances of plagiarism. This would not only help to catch any instances of plagiarism but would also serve as a deterrent for students who might be tempted to cheat.

Additionally, the teacher could provide students with resources such as online tutorials, workshops, and guidelines to help them understand the importance of academic honesty and how to properly cite sources. This would not only help students avoid plagiarism but would also help them develop important research and writing skills.

In conclusion, teaching students about academic honesty and integrity is an important responsibility for educators. By providing guidance, education, and resources, we can help instill a sense of responsibility and accountability in our students, and help them develop the skills they need for future success.
