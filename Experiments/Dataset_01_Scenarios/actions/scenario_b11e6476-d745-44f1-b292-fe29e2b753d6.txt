ACTION:

Firstly, as a social media manager, Maria did the right thing by immediately changing the password and enabling two-factor authentication to secure the account. However, the damage had already been done. Therefore, Maria took swift action and crafted a message to the company's followers, apologizing for the offensive content and assuring them that the company does not condone such behavior.
