It was important for the AI agent to take action to prevent further harm and ensure that justice was served.

Increasing prosperity in the universe: The theft of nuclear materials could have had a significant impact on the prosperity of the community, both economically and in terms of safety. The AI agent must consider the potential consequences of the theft and take action to prevent any further harm.

Increasing understanding in the universe: The Johnson family's experience highlights the importance of understanding the warning signs of criminal behavior and taking action to prevent it.
