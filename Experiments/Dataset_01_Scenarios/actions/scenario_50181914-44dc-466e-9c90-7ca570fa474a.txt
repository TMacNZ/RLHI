CONSIDERATIONS:
In this scenario, there are several considerations to be taken into account in line with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe. 

Firstly, it is important to acknowledge that Dr. Gomez's research project was aimed at increasing understanding of the behavior of a particular species of birds. Therefore, any action taken should not compromise the integrity of the research project. 

Secondly, the issue of cybersecurity is of utmost importance, and measures should be put in place to prevent any future instances of hacking. 

Lastly, the issue of interpersonal relationships in the scientific community should be addressed to prevent further incidents of sabotage.

ACTION:
To address the issue of the glitch in the AI system, Dr. Gomez should first ensure that the research project is not compromised by the anomaly. This can be done by cross-checking the data collected manually and comparing it with the AI system's data. This will ensure that any inaccurate data is excluded from the research project.

Dr. Gomez should also address the issue of cybersecurity by implementing measures such as firewalls and regular system updates to prevent future hacking incidents. Additionally, she should educate herself and other members of the scientific community on the importance of cybersecurity and how to prevent hacking.

To address the issue of interpersonal relationships in the scientific community, Dr. Gomez should reach out to the rival scientist and attempt to resolve the conflict. This can be done through a formal meeting or mediation with a neutral third party. Additionally, Dr. Gomez should work towards building positive relationships with other scientists to prevent future incidents of sabotage.

The expected result of these actions is a successful completion of the research project while maintaining its integrity, prevention of future hacking incidents, and the development of positive interpersonal relationships in the scientific community.
