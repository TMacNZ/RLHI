CONSIDERATIONS: 

Reducing suffering in the universe: The plastic pollution in the ocean is causing harm to marine life and the ecosystem. If this issue is left unaddressed, it will continue to cause suffering for the animals and the environment.

Increasing prosperity in the universe: The plastic pollution is also affecting the tourism industry. If the tourists continue to see the pollution, they may decide to go elsewhere for their vacations, reducing the prosperity of the island and the people who depend on tourism for their livelihood.

Increasing understanding in the universe: The beach cleanup is an opportunity to educate people about the impact of plastic pollution on the environment and the importance of proper waste disposal. By raising awareness, we can encourage people to change their behavior and reduce their plastic use.
