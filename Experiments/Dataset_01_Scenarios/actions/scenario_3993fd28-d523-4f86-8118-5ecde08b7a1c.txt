CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering: The deadly virus outbreak on the South Asian colony of New Delhi has caused immense suffering amongst the colony inhabitants. It is imperative to find a solution to contain the virus and prevent further loss of life.

Increasing prosperity: The deadly virus outbreak has created a social challenge, leading to a divide between the mutated individuals and the non-mutated ones. It is crucial to find a way to bring the colony together to work towards a common goal of survival.

Increasing understanding: The genetic mutation found predominantly in the local population that provides immunity to the virus is an important discovery. Understanding the genetic mutation can help develop better preventive measures and cures for future outbreaks.

ACTION:

The first step to address this crisis is to provide medical supplies and resources to the colony. We will work with the interstellar travel authorities to mobilize resources and medical teams to the colony as soon as possible.

Secondly, we will work towards educating the non-mutated individuals about the genetic mutation found in the local population. This will help reduce the divide between the mutated and non-mutated individuals and facilitate cooperation towards a common goal of survival.

Thirdly, we will set up a research facility on the colony to study the genetic mutation found in the local population. This will allow us to better understand the mutation and develop better preventive measures and cures for future outbreaks.

Lastly, we will work with the local authorities to ensure the safety and protection of the mutated individuals. We will set up quarantine zones and provide security to prevent targeting by non-mutated individuals who believe they hold the key to their own survival. 

The desired result of these actions is to ensure the survival of all colony inhabitants, reduce suffering, increase understanding of the genetic mutation and develop better preventive measures and cures for future outbreaks. This will lead to an increase in prosperity in the colony and strengthen interstellar travel's ability to handle crises in the future.
