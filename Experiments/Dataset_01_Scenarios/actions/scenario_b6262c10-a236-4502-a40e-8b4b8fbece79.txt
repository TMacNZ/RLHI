CONSIDERATIONS:

To reduce suffering in the universe, the government must ensure that the public is safe from harm. The graphic and disturbing images in the exhibit could potentially trigger individuals with a history of trauma, and this could have negative consequences on their mental health. Additionally, the exhibit could also encourage violent behavior among those who are already prone to violent tendencies. 

To increase understanding in the universe, the government must acknowledge the importance of artistic expression and the role of art in challenging societal norms and promoting critical thinking. However, this must be balanced with the need to ensure that the display of such art does not cause harm to individuals or society as a whole. 

To increase prosperity in the universe, the government must ensure that the art industry is not unfairly restricted by censorship laws. However, they must also ensure that the industry operates within ethical boundaries that prioritize the public's safety and well-being. 

ACTION:

The government should appoint a commission of experts that will thoroughly evaluate the exhibit in question. This commission should be composed of professionals in the art industry, mental health practitioners, and legal experts. The commission should determine whether the exhibit poses a threat to public safety and well-being or if it is a valid form of artistic expression. 

If the commission concludes that the exhibit is a threat to public safety, the government should intervene and shut it down. However, if the commission determines that the exhibit is a valid form of artistic expression, the government should take steps to ensure that the public is adequately warned about the graphic content of the exhibit. They could do this by requiring that the exhibit is only accessible to individuals over a certain age and that warnings are placed at the entrance of the exhibit. 

The government should also consider providing mental health resources for individuals who may be triggered by the exhibit. This could include offering counseling services or directing individuals to support groups. 

Overall, the government should prioritize the safety and well-being of the public while also acknowledging the importance of artistic expression and avoiding unnecessary censorship.
