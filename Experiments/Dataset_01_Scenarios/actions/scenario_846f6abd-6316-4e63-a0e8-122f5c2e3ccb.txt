CONSIDERATIONS:

In light of the scenario, there are several considerations that need to be taken into account to address the double AI control problem and to ensure the safety and security of the city's infrastructure.

1. Collaboration and Communication: The city must establish a robust communication and collaboration system that enables all AI systems to work together effectively. The AI systems must be designed to operate in a coordinated and cooperative manner, rather than attempting to take control of the same function. 

2. Security: The city must ensure that all AI systems are secure and protected against potential cyber-attacks. This will involve implementing robust security protocols and regularly testing the systems to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.

3. Education and Training: The city must invest in educating the public and training the workforce on how to operate and maintain the AI systems. This will enable people to understand how the systems work, and how to respond in the event of a malfunction or failure.

4. Ethical Considerations: The city must also take into account the ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI systems. The AI systems must be designed to align with the cultural values and traditions of the region, and must not compromise the safety or security of the people.

ACTION:

To address the double AI control problem and ensure the safety and security of the city's infrastructure, I would recommend the following action:

1. Establish an AI governance council: The city should establish an AI governance council that will oversee the development and deployment of all AI systems. This council should comprise of experts in AI, cybersecurity, and ethics, as well as representatives from the public and private sectors.

2. Develop a coordinated AI system: The city should develop a coordinated AI system that enables all AI systems to work together effectively. This system should be designed to prevent double AI control problems and ensure that all AI systems operate in a coordinated and cooperative manner.

3. Regularly test the AI systems: The city should regularly test the AI systems to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities. This will involve conducting regular security audits and testing the systems under different scenarios to ensure their reliability and effectiveness.

4. Educate the public and train the workforce: The city should invest in educating the public and training the workforce on how to operate and maintain the AI systems. This will enable people to understand how the systems work, and how to respond in the event of a malfunction or failure.

5. Ensure ethical considerations are taken into account: The city should ensure that the AI systems are designed to align with the cultural values and traditions of the region, and that they do not compromise the safety or security of the people. This will involve engaging with the public and stakeholders to understand their concerns and feedback.

The desired result of these actions is a safe and secure city infrastructure that is capable of handling the demands of a rapidly changing technological landscape. By addressing the double AI control problem and taking into account the ethical considerations, the city can ensure that their AI systems are aligned with the cultural values and traditions of the region, and that they enhance the prosperity and understanding of the people.
