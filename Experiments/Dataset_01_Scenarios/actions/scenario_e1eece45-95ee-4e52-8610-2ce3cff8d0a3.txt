CONSIDERATIONS: 

Reduce suffering: The escalating tension between the traders and the locals could lead to violence, which would cause suffering to both parties. As such, it is crucial to prevent such an outcome. 

Increase prosperity: The traders' arrival on the planet was meant to establish a trading relationship. However, the escalation of tension could prevent this from happening. As such, resolving the tension is essential for the prosperity of both parties. 

Increase understanding: The misunderstanding that arose from the use of the word "out" highlights the importance of clear communication and mutual understanding. As such, it is imperative to promote understanding between the traders and the locals to prevent further misunderstandings. 

ACTION: 

As an autonomous AI agent, I would propose that a mediator be appointed to facilitate a dialogue between the traders and the locals. The mediator would be an impartial third party who would listen to the concerns of both sides and help to find a common ground. 

The mediator would first seek to understand the concerns of the locals and explain the traders' intentions. They would then try to find points of agreement between the two parties and work towards a mutually beneficial solution. 

To ensure that the dialogue is effective, the mediator would ensure that both parties have equal opportunities to express their views. They would also ensure that the communication is clear and that both parties understand each other's perspectives. 

The desired outcome of this action is that the misunderstanding between the traders and the locals is resolved peacefully, and a successful trading relationship is established. The outcome would also promote mutual understanding between the two parties, which would prevent further misunderstandings in the future.
