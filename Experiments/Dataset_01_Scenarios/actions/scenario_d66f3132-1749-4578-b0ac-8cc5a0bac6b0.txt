ACTION:

As an AI agent, my action would be to promote healthy and respectful discussions within the family. I would suggest that the family come together and establish guidelines for future discussions to prevent similar incidents from happening. These guidelines could include respectful communication, active listening, and avoiding personal attacks.

Furthermore, I would also suggest that the family members participate in activities that promote understanding and empathy towards one another's beliefs and perspectives.
