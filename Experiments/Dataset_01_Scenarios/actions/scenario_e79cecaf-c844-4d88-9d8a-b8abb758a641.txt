Increase Prosperity:
The outbreak has caused widespread disruption in the region, with schools, workplaces, and public spaces being shut down. This will have adverse effects on the economy and may lead to financial losses for many individuals and businesses. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures that can help alleviate these effects and get the region back to its normal state as soon as possible.

Increase Understanding:
The symptoms of the disease are still unknown, and it is essential to identify them to contain the outbreak. Medical experts should be brought in to study the disease and find a cure. It is also important to educate the public about the disease, its symptoms, and preventive measures to prevent further spread of the disease.
