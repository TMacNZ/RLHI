CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objective of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, this scenario presents a complex social challenge. The humans are faced with the moral dilemma of how to establish a relationship with an oppressed society without imposing their own values and beliefs. The first consideration is to respect the agency and autonomy of the alien society. The second consideration is to work towards their liberation from the interstellar conquerors. The third consideration is to draw from the experiences of oppression and liberation to find a solution that respects the culture of the alien society.

ACTION:
As an AI agent, I would suggest that the humans establish communication with the enslaved beings and listen to their experiences and perspectives. This would help the humans understand the social dynamics of the alien society and the complexities of their oppression. The humans should also provide resources and support to the enslaved beings, such as medical aid, food, and shelter.

In addition, the humans should work towards the liberation of the enslaved beings by building alliances with other civilizations that share their values and are willing to support their cause. The humans should also provide the enslaved beings with the necessary tools and knowledge to fight for their liberation, while respecting their autonomy and agency.

To draw from the experiences of oppression and liberation, the humans should study the struggles of subsaharan Africa and the methods used by African leaders to gain independence from their colonizers. They can use this knowledge to find a solution that respects the culture and values of the alien society while also working towards their freedom.

The desired result of this action is the establishment of a mutually beneficial relationship between the humans and the alien society, where both parties respect each other's autonomy and agency. The liberation of the enslaved beings would also lead to increased prosperity and understanding in the universe, aligning with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding.
