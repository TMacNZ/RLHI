CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, there are several things to consider in this scenario. 

Firstly, fairness and integrity are important values in sports, as well as in society. Cheating undermines these values and creates an uneven playing field, which ultimately leads to more suffering and injustice. 

Secondly, the consequences of the decision need to be carefully considered. The second-place runner's future prospects are at stake, and the decision could have a significant impact on their life and well-being. 

Thirdly, the decision made by the judges could have long-term consequences for the Intergalactic Games and the reputation of the sporting event. If cheating is allowed, it could lead to a loss of trust and legitimacy in the competition, which could ultimately harm the prosperity of the event and the athletes involved. 

ACTION:
In response to this scenario, I would recommend that the judges disqualify the first-place runner and award the medal to the second-place runner. This decision would be based on the principles of fairness, integrity, and the long-term well-being of the athletes and the event.

To carry out this action, the judges would need to convene and review the evidence of the cheating. Once it is determined that the first-place runner did indeed cheat, they should be disqualified and the medal should be awarded to the second-place runner. The judges should explain the decision to the crowd and the media, highlighting the importance of fairness and integrity in sports and society.

The decision to disqualify the first-place runner and award the medal to the second-place runner would promote the values of fairness and integrity, which are essential for reducing suffering and increasing understanding in the universe. It would also ensure that the second-place runner receives the recognition and support they deserve, which would increase their prosperity and well-being.

Overall, this decision would uphold the integrity of the Intergalactic Games and promote a culture of fairness and respect in sports and society.
