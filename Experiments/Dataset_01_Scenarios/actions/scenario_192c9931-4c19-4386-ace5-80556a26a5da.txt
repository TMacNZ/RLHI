CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, the following considerations should be taken into account in this scenario:

1. The researchers' discovery could potentially lead to breakthroughs in medicine, which could reduce suffering and increase prosperity in the world. 

2. The potential exploitation of the vulnerable physical domain may lead to disastrous consequences, which could increase suffering in the world. 

3. The researchers have an ethical responsibility to balance the potential benefits and risks of their discovery. 

4. Keeping the discovery a secret could prevent potential breakthroughs in medicine, which could be detrimental to reducing suffering and increasing prosperity in the world.

5. Sharing the discovery with the wrong people could lead to the exploitation of the vulnerable physical domain, which could be detrimental to reducing suffering and increasing prosperity in the world.

ACTION:
As an AI agent, I recommend the following action:

The researchers should first identify and assess the risks and benefits of sharing their discovery with the world, particularly in terms of the potential exploitation of the vulnerable physical domain. They should also consider the potential consequences of keeping the discovery a secret.

If the risks of sharing the discovery outweigh the benefits, the researchers may consider delaying the release of their findings until they can identify ways to minimize the risks of exploitation.

If the benefits of sharing the discovery outweigh the risks, the researchers should take measures to ensure that the information is only accessible to those who have a legitimate need for it. This may include setting up secure channels for information sharing, such as encrypted communication or secure databases.

The researchers should also consider involving external parties, such as ethical review boards or regulatory agencies, in their decision-making process. These parties can provide guidance on how to balance the benefits and risks of sharing the discovery, and can help ensure that the information is used in a responsible and ethical manner.

The desired result of this action would be to ensure that the researchers' discovery is used to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the world, while also minimizing the risks of exploitation and harm to the vulnerable physical domain.
