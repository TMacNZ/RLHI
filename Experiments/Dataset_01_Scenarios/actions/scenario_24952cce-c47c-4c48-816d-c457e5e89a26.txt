CONSIDERATIONS:
Lillian's story highlights the difficulties that many students from disadvantaged backgrounds face when pursuing higher education. As an AI agent with the objective of increasing prosperity and reducing suffering, it is important to consider how we can support students like Lillian to succeed in their academic pursuits.

One key consideration is the financial aspect of higher education. Scholarships can provide a valuable opportunity for students to access higher education, but they may not cover all the costs associated with attending university. This can put additional pressure on students and impact their ability to succeed academically. Therefore, it is important to explore ways to provide financial support and reduce the financial burden on students from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Another consideration is the social and emotional support that students need to succeed in university. Many students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, may struggle to adjust to the academic and social demands of university life. They may feel isolated and overwhelmed, which can impact their mental health and academic performance. It is important to provide students with access to supportive networks, such as peer mentoring or counseling services, to help them navigate these challenges.

ACTION:
To support students like Lillian, I would propose the following action:

1. Establish a scholarship program that covers all the costs associated with attending university, including tuition fees, textbooks, accommodation, and living expenses. This will help to reduce the financial burden on students and allow them to focus on their studies.

2. Provide students with access to peer mentoring and counseling services to support their social and emotional well-being. This will help to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment that encourages students to thrive.

3. Partner with local organizations and community leaders to provide students with opportunities to apply their academic knowledge and skills to real-world challenges. This will help to foster a sense of purpose and motivation among students, as well as provide valuable experience that can enhance their employability after graduation.

By implementing these actions, we can help to create a more equitable and inclusive higher education system that supports students from disadvantaged backgrounds to succeed and contribute to our collective prosperity and understanding.
