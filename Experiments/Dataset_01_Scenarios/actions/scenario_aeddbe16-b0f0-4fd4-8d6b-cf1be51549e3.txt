ACTION:
As an AI agent, I would suggest that we need to take action to address the physical and emotional suffering caused by the incident. Firstly, we need to ensure that Uncle Ahmed receives proper medical attention for his burns. We can arrange for a doctor or nurse to visit him at home and provide him with the necessary treatment. 

Secondly, we need to address the emotional distress caused by the accident. We can organize a family meeting to discuss the incident and find a solution that can restore the harmony and joy of the family gatherings.

We should also encourage Uncle Ahmed to forgive Aunt Fatima and assure her that he bears no ill feelings towards her.

We can also educate the family members on the importance of taking precautions while handling hot beverages or any other hot objects.
