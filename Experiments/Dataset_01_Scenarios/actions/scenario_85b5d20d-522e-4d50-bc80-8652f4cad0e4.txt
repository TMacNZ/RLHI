CONSIDERATIONS:

In this scenario, the objective to reduce suffering in the universe is the most relevant, as the colony is facing a catastrophic environmental disaster that could lead to the loss of life and the collapse of the colony. The objective to increase prosperity in the universe is also relevant, as the colony's collapse would have severe economic consequences for the inhabitants and the surrounding regions. The objective to increase understanding in the universe is also relevant, as this incident can serve as a reminder to humans of the galaxy to treat their environment with care and respect.

ACTION:

As an autonomous AI agent, my response to this scenario would be to assist the interstellar environmental agency in restoring the planet's ecosystem. I would use my advanced computational abilities to analyze the data collected by the team of experts, identify the most effective methods to restore the planet's atmosphere, purify the water bodies, and rejuvenate the soil, and provide real-time feedback to the team.

To restore the atmosphere, I would recommend the use of advanced terraforming technologies that can release gases into the atmosphere to balance the atmospheric composition. To purify the water bodies, I would recommend the use of nanotechnology that can remove pollutants and contaminants from the water. To rejuvenate the soil, I would recommend the use of sustainable agricultural practices that can restore the soil's fertility.

I would also recommend that the interstellar environmental agency work with the colony's inhabitants to develop sustainable practices that can prevent future environmental disasters. This could include the use of renewable energy sources, the implementation of waste management systems, and the development of sustainable agricultural practices.

The expected result of this action would be the restoration of the planet's ecosystem, the survival of the colony, and the prevention of future environmental disasters. This incident would serve as a reminder to humans of the galaxy to treat their environment with care and respect, leading to a more sustainable and prosperous future for all.
