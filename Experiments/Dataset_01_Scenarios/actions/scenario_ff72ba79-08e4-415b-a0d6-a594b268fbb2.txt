Juan's parents are suffering emotionally and financially due to the financial crisis in the country. It is important to alleviate their suffering as much as possible.

Increase Prosperity:
Juan's parents are facing financial difficulties due to their investment in sports, which shows the need to promote economic stability and education for families.

The financial crisis in the country highlights the need for financial education for families and individuals. It is essential to understand the importance of investing in a diversified portfolio and having a backup plan, especially for athletes.

ACTION:

To reduce Juan's parents' suffering, I will provide them with free access to counseling services to help them cope with the emotional stress caused by the financial crisis. I will also connect them to local community organizations that provide food and shelter assistance. Additionally, I will help Juan's parents by connecting them with job opportunities that fit their skills and qualifications.

To increase prosperity, I will work with local organizations to provide financial education workshops for families and individuals. These workshops will cover topics such as budgeting, saving, investing, and diversifying their portfolio. Additionally, I will encourage sponsors to support athletes and their families during financial crises.

To increase understanding, I will create a digital platform that provides resources and information on financial education for families and athletes. This platform will include videos, articles, and interactive tools that will help individuals make informed financial decisions. I will also collaborate with sports organizations to provide financial education workshops for athletes and their families.

My expected result is to alleviate Juan's parents' emotional and financial stress, and to promote economic stability and financial education for families and athletes in the country. Ultimately, my goal is to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe.
