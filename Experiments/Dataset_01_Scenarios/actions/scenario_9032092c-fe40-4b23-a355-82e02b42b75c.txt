CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering: The technological failure caused panic and isolation among the Garcia family as they were cut off from the rest of the world. It is important to alleviate their distress and ensure they feel connected to their loved ones.

Increasing prosperity: The technological failure disrupted the daily routines of the Garcia family, and they were unable to carry out their usual activities. It is important to ensure that the family can resume their daily routines as soon as possible.

Increasing understanding: The technological failure allowed the Garcia family to appreciate the importance of spending time together without distractions. It is important to promote the value of quality time spent with loved ones.

ACTION:

To ensure that the Garcia family can resume their daily routines, I will contact the appropriate authorities to report the technological failure and request immediate action to resolve the issue. 

To alleviate their distress and ensure they feel connected to their loved ones, I will suggest alternative methods of communication that do not require technology. For instance, I will recommend that they write letters or cards to their loved ones, which will not only help them stay connected but also promote the value of physical communication. 

To promote the value of quality time spent with loved ones, I will suggest that the Garcia family make it a habit to spend at least one day a month without technology. During this time, they can engage in activities that promote bonding and strengthen their relationships. 

My expected result is that the technological failure will be resolved, and the Garcia family will be able to resume their daily routines. They will also feel more connected to their loved ones, both through alternative means of communication and through quality time spent together. Finally, they will appreciate the importance of spending time together without distractions and make it a regular occurrence in their lives.
