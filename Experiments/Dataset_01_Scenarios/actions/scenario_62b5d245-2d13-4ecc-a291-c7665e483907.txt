ACTION: 

As an AI agent, my primary objective is to reduce suffering. Therefore, the first step would be to provide assistance to the injured and those affected by the incident. I would coordinate with the emergency crews and other relevant authorities to ensure that people receive medical care and support.

Next, I would work towards increasing understanding by facilitating a dialogue between the rival factions.

This could involve mediation, conflict resolution training, or other methods to promote understanding and cooperation.

Finally, to increase prosperity, I would work with the conference organizers to develop a plan to repair the building and continue the conference. This would involve identifying alternative venues, promoting attendance, and providing the necessary resources to ensure that the conference can continue without interruption.

Overall, my actions would be aimed at reducing suffering, increasing understanding, and promoting prosperity. By addressing the root causes of the disagreement and providing support to those affected by the incident, we can work towards a more peaceful and prosperous future.
