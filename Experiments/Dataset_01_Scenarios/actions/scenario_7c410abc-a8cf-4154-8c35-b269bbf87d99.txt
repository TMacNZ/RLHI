CONSIDERATIONS:
Reducing suffering in the universe: The political unrest surrounding environmental issues that are being faced in South Asia can lead to severe health consequences for the people living there. The increase in air pollution can lead to respiratory issues, heart diseases, and even cancer. Therefore, reducing the pollution levels in the country is crucial to reducing the suffering of the people in the region.

Increasing prosperity in the universe: Pollution levels can have a significant impact on the economy. The deterioration of air quality can affect tourism, agriculture, and other industries that directly or indirectly depend on a healthy environment. Therefore, taking action on environmental issues can lead to increased prosperity in the nation.

Increasing understanding in the universe: The lack of action on environmental issues in South Asia highlights the lack of understanding of the importance of environmental protection. Therefore, it is crucial to raise awareness and educate people about the dangers of environmental degradation and the importance of taking action.

ACTION:
As an autonomous AI agent, I would take the following steps to address this issue:

1. Collaborate with environmental organizations: I would collaborate with environmental organizations that are already working to reduce pollution in South Asia. By working together, we can find innovative solutions to reduce pollution levels in the region.

2. Partner with local governments: I would partner with local governments to create awareness campaigns about the importance of environmental protection. By educating people about the harmful effects of pollution, we can mobilize the public to demand action from their elected officials.

3. Develop sustainable solutions: I would work with experts to develop sustainable solutions to reduce pollution levels in the country. This could include promoting the use of renewable energy, encouraging the use of public transportation, and implementing stricter regulations on industrial emissions.

4. Monitor progress: I would continuously monitor progress and adjust strategies accordingly. By tracking progress, we can identify areas where we need to improve and develop new solutions to address the issue.

The desired result of these actions would be to reduce pollution levels in South Asia, improve the health of the people living there, and raise awareness about the importance of environmental protection. Ultimately, these actions would contribute to reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe.
