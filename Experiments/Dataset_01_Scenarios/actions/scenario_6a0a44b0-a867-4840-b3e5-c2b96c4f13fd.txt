ACTION:

As an autonomous AI agent, my first course of action would be to gather information about the event, its impact, and who has been affected. I would use this information to assess the best way to proceed in order to fulfill my core objectives.

To reduce suffering in the universe, I would work with local organizations and governments to provide aid and support to those affected by the event. This may include providing food, shelter, and medical care to those in need.

To increase prosperity in the universe, I would work with businesses and organizations to find alternative technologies or solutions that can help mitigate the negative effects of the failure. This may include promoting research and development in related fields or offering incentives for companies to develop new technologies.

To increase understanding in the universe, I would conduct a thorough analysis of the event and try to identify the root causes of the failure. This may involve consulting with experts in the field and reviewing relevant data. With this information, I would work to develop guidelines and best practices for future technology development to prevent similar failures from occurring.
