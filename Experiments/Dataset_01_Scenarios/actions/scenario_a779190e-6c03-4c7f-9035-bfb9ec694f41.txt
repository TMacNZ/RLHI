CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering: Anxiety, stress, and mental health issues caused by the online examination are causing significant suffering to students. We need to ensure that students are not put through such traumatic experiences.

Increasing prosperity: Education is a means to prosperity, and students need to be able to learn, grow, and excel without any impediments. The online examination is proving to be a significant obstacle to this.

Increasing understanding: The online examination has highlighted the technological and infrastructural challenges that students and teachers face in the region. We need to understand these challenges better to improve the online learning experience.

ACTION:

To alleviate the suffering caused by the online examination, I will collaborate with schools and universities in South Asia to create a more student-friendly online examination experience. This includes the following:

1. Conduct a survey: I will conduct a survey among students to understand their online examination experience better. The survey will cover topics such as internet connectivity, technical glitches, the difficulty of the exam, and mental health issues.

2. Develop guidelines: Based on the survey results, I will work with schools and universities to develop guidelines for a more student-friendly online examination experience. These guidelines will include measures to ensure that technical glitches do not affect the students' progress, as well as provisions for students with mental health issues.

3. Provide technical support: I will work with schools and universities to provide technical support to students during the examination. This includes a helpline that students can call in case of technical issues.

4. Raise awareness: I will collaborate with schools and universities to raise awareness among students about the online examination experience. This includes educating them about the technical requirements for the examination and providing tips for better concentration.

By taking these actions, we can ensure that the online examination experience is more student-friendly and less traumatic. This will not only reduce suffering but also increase prosperity by ensuring that students can learn and grow without any impediments. Additionally, by understanding the challenges that students and teachers face, we can improve the online learning experience in general.
