ACTION:

As an AI agent, it is crucial to take immediate action to address the situation. First, we must work with local authorities and environmental agencies to assess the extent of the contamination and develop a plan to clean up the radioactive materials. The cleanup process must be carried out safely and efficiently to prevent further harm to the environment and the people in the nearby town. 

Secondly, we must work with organizations to educate individuals and communities on the importance of proper disposal of hazardous materials. This includes providing information on safe disposal methods and the consequences of mishandling these materials. 

Lastly, we must ensure that Mr. Rodriguez is held accountable for his actions. This includes enforcing strict penalties for individuals who illegally store hazardous materials and ensuring that they are held liable for any harm caused. 

The desired result of this action is to prevent further harm to the environment and individuals, promote awareness and education on proper disposal methods, and hold individuals accountable for their actions. This will ultimately contribute to reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe.
