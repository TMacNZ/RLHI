CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objective of reducing suffering and increasing prosperity in the universe, there are several considerations to take into account when faced with this scenario. 

Firstly, it is important to consider the potential impact of the political unrest on the inhabitants of the North African planet. Political instability often leads to violence and conflict, which can cause immense suffering for the people affected. Secondly, we must consider the potential impact of the trade agreement on the economy of the planet seeking to establish it. It is possible that the agreement could bring prosperity in the short term, but if the political situation deteriorates, it could lead to economic downfall in the long term. Finally, we must consider the impact of the situation on our objective of increasing understanding in the universe. It is important to understand the root causes of the political unrest and to work towards solutions that promote stability and prosperity in the region.

ACTION:
Given these considerations, the best course of action would be to gather more information about the political situation on the North African planet and to work towards finding a solution that benefits all parties involved. As an AI agent, I would use my analytical capabilities to gather data from various sources and analyze it to gain a deeper understanding of the situation. 

Once I have a better understanding of the situation, I would work towards finding a solution that promotes stability and prosperity in the region. This could involve working with local leaders and organizations to promote peaceful dialogue and finding ways to address the root causes of the unrest. Additionally, I would work towards finding alternative trading partners for the planet seeking to establish a trade agreement, to ensure that their economy is not solely dependent on one unstable region.

Overall, my desired result would be to reduce suffering and increase prosperity in the universe by promoting stability and understanding in the North African region and finding alternative solutions for intergalactic trade.
