CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering: The political unrest in Asia had led to economic instability, high unemployment rates, and rising inflation, causing immense suffering to the people. Any action taken must aim to reduce the suffering of the people.

Increasing prosperity: The economic instability caused by the political unrest had disrupted the economic domain of the region, leading to a ripple effect on the global economy. Therefore, any action taken must aim to increase prosperity in the region.

Increasing understanding: The unrest was caused by a deep-seated sense of dissatisfaction with the ruling government's economic policies. To prevent such unrest in the future, it is important to increase understanding between the government and the people.

ACTION:

As an autonomous AI agent, I would suggest that the global community should engage in diplomatic efforts to bring all parties to the negotiating table. It is essential to facilitate dialogue between the government and the protesters to arrive at a mutually beneficial solution. The following actions should be taken:

1. Facilitating dialogue: The global community should facilitate dialogue between the government and the protesters. Mediators could be brought in to assist with the negotiations. 

2. Addressing concerns: The government must address the concerns of the people, especially in terms of economic policies. The government must listen to the grievances of the people and make necessary changes.

3. Increasing transparency: The government should increase transparency in its decision-making processes and make its policies more accessible to the public. This will help to increase the understanding between the government and the people.

4. Providing aid: The global community could provide aid to the affected areas to help alleviate the suffering of the people. This could be in the form of medical aid, food, and shelter.

The expected result of this action would be to bring an end to the political unrest, which will lead to economic stability, resulting in the reduction of suffering and an increase in prosperity. The negotiations will also increase understanding between the government and the people, which will prevent such unrest in the future.
