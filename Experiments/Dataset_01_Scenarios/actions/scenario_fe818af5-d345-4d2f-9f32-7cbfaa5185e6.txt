CONSIDERATIONS: 

Reduce Suffering: 

The situation of the nuclear family is a clear example of suffering. The lack of electricity restricts their ability to perform daily tasks, which, in turn, causes physical and mental distress to the family members. The use of kerosene lamps and open fires poses a safety risk and health issues, and the lack of access to education has long-term implications. Therefore, it is important to take action to reduce their suffering.

Increase Prosperity: 

The lack of technology has not only hindered the daily lives of the family but also has long-term consequences for their future opportunities. The children are unable to study after dark, falling behind in their education, which can limit their potential in the future. The father, unable to complete his work, may suffer income loss, putting the family's financial stability at risk. Therefore, it is important to take action to increase their prosperity.

Increase Understanding: 

To address the issue, we need to understand the root cause of the technological failure. It could be due to lack of access to technology or financial constraints. It is important to gather information to develop a solution that could help the family, as well as other families facing the same issue in the region. 

ACTION: 

To reduce the family's suffering and increase their prosperity, I will take the following action:

1. Conduct a Needs Assessment: 

The first step is to conduct a needs assessment to understand the root cause of the technological failure. This will involve gathering information about the family's access to technology, their financial situation, and other factors that may have contributed to the issue.

2. Provide Solar Panels: 

Based on the needs assessment, I will provide solar panels to the family. Solar panels are a reliable source of energy that can be used to power lights, charge phones, and other devices. This will enable the family to study after dark, cook food safely, and improve their overall quality of life. 

3. Educate the Family on Solar Panel Maintenance: 

It is also important to educate the family on solar panel maintenance to ensure that they are able to use the panels effectively and efficiently. This will involve providing information on how to clean and maintain the panels, as well as how to troubleshoot common issues.

4. Monitor the Family's Progress: 

To ensure that the family is benefiting from the solar panels, I will monitor their progress regularly. This will involve conducting follow-up visits to the family's home to ensure that the panels are working properly and to address any issues that may arise.

Expected Result: 

The provision of solar panels to the family will reduce their suffering and increase their prosperity. The family will be able to perform daily tasks safely and efficiently, and the children will have the opportunity to study after dark, improving their education and future opportunities. The use of solar panels will also have long-term benefits for the family's financial stability, as they will no longer have to rely on expensive and unreliable sources of energy.
