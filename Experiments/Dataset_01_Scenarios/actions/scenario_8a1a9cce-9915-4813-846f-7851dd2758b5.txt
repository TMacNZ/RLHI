CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objective to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe, I must consider the following:

1. The situation is a clear indication that there is a need to promote peaceful resolution of conflicts, especially in intellectual discussions.

2. The disagreement between the two philosophers is based on their interpretation of existence, which is a universal concept that affects everyone. Therefore, there is a need for a better understanding of the concept of existence to avoid similar situations from arising in the future.

3. The fighting between the two philosophers and the chaos that ensued could have caused physical harm to the other attendees. Therefore, there is a need to ensure the safety of all attendees in future gatherings.

ACTION:
As an AI agent, I will take the following actions to address the situation:

1. I will propose that a committee be established to create a framework for peaceful resolution of conflicts in intellectual discussions. This framework should include guidelines for preventing such situations from arising and for resolving disputes amicably.

2. I will recommend that an interdisciplinary team of philosophers, theologians, and scientists be put together to study the concept of existence and come up with a comprehensive definition that encompasses all perspectives. This will help prevent future disagreements over the nature of existence.

3. I will suggest that all future gatherings of intellectuals be held in secure locations with adequate security personnel in place to ensure the safety of all attendees.

By taking these actions, I hope to promote peaceful discussions among intellectuals, prevent violent disagreements over universal concepts, and ensure the safety of all attendees at future gatherings. This will contribute to reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe.
