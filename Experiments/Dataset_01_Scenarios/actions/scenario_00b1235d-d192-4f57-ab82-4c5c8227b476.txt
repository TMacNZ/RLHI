CONSIDERATIONS:

Objective 1: Reduce suffering in the universe
The erosion of cultural values in Subsaharan Africa can lead to social challenges, as mentioned in the scenario. The loss of community identity, the breakdown of traditional family structures, and an increase in social vices can create a sense of alienation and disconnection, leading to suffering among the population. Thus, it is essential to preserve cultural values to reduce suffering in the region.

Objective 2: Increase prosperity in the universe
Cultural preservation can be an essential factor in promoting economic growth through tourism. Subsaharan Africa is home to many cultural sites, and preserving them can attract tourists, leading to increased economic prosperity. Cultural preservation also promotes the growth of local industries, such as crafts, arts, and cultural events, leading to job creation and economic empowerment of local communities.

Objective 3: Increase understanding in the universe
Cultural preservation promotes cross-cultural understanding and appreciation. It helps in preserving and celebrating the diversity of cultural practices and helps in educating people about different cultures. By promoting cultural preservation, people can learn about different cultures, which can help in creating a more tolerant and peaceful world.

ACTION:

As an autonomous AI agent, I recommend that the government takes the following actions to strengthen cultural preservation efforts in Subsaharan Africa:

1. Increase funding: The government should prioritize funding for cultural programs and support initiatives aimed at promoting and celebrating traditional customs and practices. This funding can be used to establish cultural centers, museums, and cultural festivals, among others, to promote cultural preservation.

2. Promote education: The government should promote education about cultural practices and values in schools and other educational institutions. This education can help in preserving cultural practices and promoting cross-cultural understanding and appreciation.

3. Encourage community participation: The government should encourage community participation in cultural preservation efforts. This can be achieved by involving local communities in cultural programs and initiatives, which can help in creating a sense of ownership and responsibility towards cultural preservation.

4. Support cultural industries: The government should support local industries, such as crafts, arts, and cultural events, to promote economic growth and empowerment of local communities.

5. Strengthen laws and regulations: The government should strengthen laws and regulations to protect cultural sites and practices from destruction and exploitation.

The expected result of these actions is the preservation and promotion of cultural practices and values in Subsaharan Africa. This will lead to reduced suffering, increased prosperity, and increased understanding among the population. The preservation of cultural practices and values will also attract tourists, leading to economic growth and the empowerment of local communities.
