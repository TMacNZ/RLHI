Increasing understanding in the universe: 

- The researcher's realization that the secretary's role was more valuable than initially thought demonstrates a potential lack of understanding in the importance of administrative tasks in research work.

- Reduce the suffering of the secretary by providing her with employment again. 
- Increase prosperity by providing a job opportunity. 
- Increase understanding by acknowledging the value of administrative tasks in research work and ensuring they are adequately addressed.

They should also communicate with the secretary and apologize for the mistake. This action will help to rebuild trust and foster a positive work environment. 

The researcher should also use this experience to re-evaluate their decision-making process and consider the potential consequences of their actions. This reflection will help to avoid similar situations in the future and ensure that their decisions align with their objectives. 

Overall, the researcher's decision to rehire the secretary or delegate tasks to another employee will increase understanding, prosperity, and reduce suffering in the universe.
