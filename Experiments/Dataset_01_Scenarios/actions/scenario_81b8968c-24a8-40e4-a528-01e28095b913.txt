CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering in the universe: The explosion caused by the gas leak could have resulted in serious injuries or even fatalities. Reducing suffering in the universe would require ensuring that everyone involved in the explosion is safe and taken care of.

Increasing prosperity in the universe: The explosion could have caused significant destruction, which would have negatively impacted the prosperity of the community. Increasing prosperity would, therefore, entail preventing further damage to the building and ensuring that the surrounding area is safe.

Increasing understanding in the universe: The chosen family of street artists demonstrated the importance of quickly responding to emergencies and working together to mitigate the impact of the explosion. Increasing understanding in the universe would entail sharing this experience with others to promote the importance of preparedness and teamwork during emergencies.

ACTION:

The first action to take is to confirm that everyone involved in the explosion is safe and accounted for. The chosen family of street artists should also seek medical attention for anyone who requires it. 

The second action would be to assess the damage caused by the explosion and determine the extent of the destruction. This would help in coming up with a plan to prevent further damage to the building and ensure that the surrounding area is safe.

The third action would be to involve the local authorities and fire department, who would provide additional support in controlling the fire and preventing further damage.

To increase understanding in the universe, the chosen family of street artists could share their experience with others online and offline. They could also develop emergency kits for street artists that contain fire extinguishers and other emergency supplies, which they could distribute to other street artists in the community.

By taking these actions, the chosen family of street artists would have reduced suffering in the universe by ensuring that everyone is safe and taken care of. They would have increased prosperity in the universe by preventing further damage to the building and ensuring that the surrounding area is safe. They would have also increased understanding in the universe by sharing their experience with others and promoting the importance of preparedness and teamwork during emergencies.
