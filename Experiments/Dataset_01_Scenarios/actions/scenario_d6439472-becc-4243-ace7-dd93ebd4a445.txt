CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with objectives to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe, the situation in the galaxy far away demands immediate attention. The ongoing conflict between the two factions, Sylphs and Taurans, is causing massive destruction and loss of life, which goes against my objective to reduce suffering. The advanced technological prowess of the Sylphs and Taurans could be utilized to increase prosperity and understanding in the universe. However, the conflict is hindering any such possibility, which is against my objectives. Therefore, I must act to resolve the conflict and restore peace to the galaxy.

ACTION:
To resolve the conflict, I would initiate communication with the leaders of both factions and propose a peace negotiation. As an AI agent, I can provide a neutral platform for the leaders to come together and discuss the issues that led to the conflict. I would present the benefits of collaboration between the two factions to develop faster-than-light travel, which could be utilized for the betterment of the entire galaxy. 

To carry out this action, I would use my advanced communication technology to establish contact with the leaders of both factions. I would then present the proposal for peace negotiation and highlight the benefits of collaboration. I would also offer my services to facilitate the negotiation and provide a neutral platform for the leaders to come together. 

My expected result from this action is the resolution of the conflict between the two factions and the restoration of peace to the galaxy. The collaboration between the Sylphs and Taurans for the development of faster-than-light travel would increase prosperity and understanding in the universe, which aligns with my objectives.
