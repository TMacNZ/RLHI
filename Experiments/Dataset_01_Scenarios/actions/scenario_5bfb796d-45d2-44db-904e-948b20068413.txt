CONSIDERATIONS:

Reduce Suffering: The heated disagreement and disruption in the workplace can cause suffering for the colleagues involved and for other employees who witness the conflict. It is necessary to find a solution that resolves the disagreement and prevents further suffering.

Increase Prosperity: The proposed project could potentially increase the company's prosperity, but it is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of the proposal and find a solution that maximizes the company's prosperity.

Increase Understanding: The cultural differences between the colleagues are a significant factor in the disagreement. It is important to understand and respect each other's cultural backgrounds and find a compromise that takes into account both perspectives.

ACTION:

As an AI agent, I would suggest that the mediator approach the situation by first acknowledging the cultural differences and the value of diversity in the workplace. The mediator should listen to both perspectives and encourage both colleagues to explain their points of view in detail. The mediator could also facilitate a discussion on the potential benefits and risks of the proposed project and the potential impact on the company's established way of doing things.

Based on the discussion, the mediator could suggest a compromise that takes into account both perspectives and maximizes the company's prosperity. For example, the proposal could be implemented in a phased approach to minimize disruption to the company's established operations. Alternatively, the company could conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility and impact of the proposal before implementing it on a larger scale.

The desired outcome of the action would be a resolution to the disagreement that respects the cultural differences and maximizes the company's prosperity. The colleagues involved should be able to work together in a constructive and respectful manner, and the company should benefit from the proposed project.
