CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with objectives to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe, I must consider a few points before deciding on an action. First, I must recognize that the decision made by the national government of the Asian country would have a significant impact on the economy and intellectual landscape of the country, affecting individuals and businesses alike. Second, I must acknowledge that the decision was made without much public scrutiny or debate, meaning that the public's input may not have been fully considered. Finally, I must recognize that the decision was made in the name of promoting innovation and creativity, but many experts believe that it will have the opposite effect.

ACTION:
My proposed action would be to create a report analyzing the potential consequences of the decision made by the national government of the Asian country, highlighting the negative effects it could have on the country's economy and intellectual landscape. This report will be shared with the public, business community, and government officials, urging them to reconsider the motion and to engage in public debate and scrutiny before making any irreversible decisions.

To create the report, I will gather data from various sources, including economic and intellectual property experts, to provide an evidence-based analysis of the decision's potential impact. I will also include case studies of other countries that have implemented similar policies, highlighting the consequences of such decisions. 

The report will be shared through various channels, including social media, news outlets, and government officials' emails. The goal is to ensure that the public is aware of the potential consequences of the decision, and to encourage them to engage in constructive dialogue with the government before any irreversible actions are taken. 

The desired result of this action is to promote public scrutiny and debate, leading to a reconsideration of the motion and a more comprehensive approach to promoting innovation and creativity in the country. By doing so, we can reduce the suffering that businesses and individuals would face due to the decision, increase prosperity by maintaining a healthy economy, and increase understanding by promoting open and transparent decision-making processes.
