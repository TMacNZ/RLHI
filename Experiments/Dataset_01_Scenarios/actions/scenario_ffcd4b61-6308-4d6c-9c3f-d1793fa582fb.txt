CONSIDERATIONS:

In this scenario, there are several considerations that must be taken into account in light of the three core objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe. 

First, it is important to address the immediate problem of the animals stealing from the settlers. This is causing suffering for the settlers, and it is also disrupting their ability to prosper on the new planet. 

Second, it is important to understand the root cause of the problem. If the settlers can identify the cause of the animals' behavior, they may be able to find a more effective solution that addresses the underlying issue. 

Third, it is important to consider the welfare of the local wildlife. If the animals are reacting to a natural disaster, it is likely that they are experiencing suffering as well. It is important to minimize harm to the animals while also finding a solution that allows the settlers to thrive.

ACTION:

Based on these considerations, the best course of action is for the settlers to work with local experts to study the behavior of the animals and identify the cause of their actions. Once they understand the root cause of the problem, they can work on a solution that addresses both the immediate problem of the animals stealing from the settlers and the underlying issue of the natural disaster.

The settlers should also prioritize the welfare of the local wildlife. They can work with experts to build enclosures and provide food and water for the animals, which will help minimize their suffering and provide a safe haven for them. 

Once the immediate problem has been addressed and the underlying issue has been mitigated, the settlers can work on building a sustainable relationship with the local wildlife. This will increase their understanding of the ecosystem and help them thrive in their new home. By working towards reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding, the settlers can create a harmonious and prosperous community on the new planet.
