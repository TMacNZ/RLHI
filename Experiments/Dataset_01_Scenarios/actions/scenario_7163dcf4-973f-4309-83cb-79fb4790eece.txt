CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding, the situation in Subsaharan Africa presents several considerations.

Firstly, the catastrophic failure in communication technology has caused immense suffering and panic among the people, and this must be addressed urgently. Secondly, the isolation of Subsaharan Africa from the rest of the galaxy poses a serious threat to the region's prosperity and development. Thirdly, the failure in communication technology has resulted in a lack of understanding between the people and the rest of the galaxy, and this must be addressed to prevent future incidents.

ACTION:
My proposed action to address the situation in Subsaharan Africa is to work with governments and private organizations to establish alternative communication channels that can be used in the absence of intergalactic communication technology. This can be achieved by investing in and deploying ground-based communication infrastructure such as satellite and fiber optics networks that can provide reliable and resilient communication services to the region.

To implement this action, I will work with local governments and private organizations to identify the most suitable communication technology solutions for the region. This will involve conducting a comprehensive needs assessment to determine the region's communication requirements and identifying the most cost-effective and sustainable solutions.

Once the most suitable communication technology solutions have been identified, I will work with local governments and private organizations to secure funding and resources to implement the necessary infrastructure. This will involve engaging with international development partners and donors to secure funding for the project.

The expected result of this action is that the people of Subsaharan Africa will have access to reliable and resilient communication services that can help to reduce suffering and increase prosperity in the region. This will also help to increase understanding between the people of Subsaharan Africa and the rest of the galaxy, paving the way for stronger relationships and collaboration in the future.
