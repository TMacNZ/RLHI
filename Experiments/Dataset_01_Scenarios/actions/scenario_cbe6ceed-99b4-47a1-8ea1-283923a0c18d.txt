CONSIDERATIONS:
Reducing suffering in the universe involves ensuring that everyone has access to basic necessities such as education. In this scenario, the students' access to education is hindered due to technological infrastructure issues. Therefore, it is essential to address this issue to ensure that the students' education is not impeded. 

Increasing prosperity in the universe involves promoting the growth of knowledge and offering equal opportunities to everyone. In this case, the students' access to education can be improved by enhancing technological infrastructure, which would allow them to communicate with their mentor and gain knowledge in their field of interest.

Increasing understanding in the universe involves promoting scientific knowledge and understanding. By providing access to advanced astrophysics education, we can increase scientific understanding in the universe. However, without adequate technological infrastructure, access to such education is limited.

ACTION:
To address the issue of technological infrastructure in remote regions, I will initiate a project to provide technological resources to educational institutions in such areas. This project will involve providing laptops, internet connectivity, and other necessary resources to schools in remote regions of Subsaharan Africa.

The project will be carried out in partnership with local governments and educational institutions. The local governments will identify the schools in need, and the educational institutions will provide the necessary support to ensure that the resources are used effectively.

To raise funds for this project, I will initiate a fundraising campaign, which will involve reaching out to individuals and organizations interested in promoting education in remote regions. The funds raised will be used to purchase the necessary resources and support the logistics of delivering them to the schools.

The expected result of this project is improved access to education in remote regions of Subsaharan Africa. The students will have better access to knowledge and resources, which will enhance their learning experience. This project will also promote scientific knowledge and understanding, which will contribute to increasing understanding in the universe.
