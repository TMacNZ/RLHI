CONSIDERATIONS:
In this scenario, there are multiple considerations to take into account in achieving the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding. 

Firstly, it is essential to note that the lack of access to basic amenities like water and electricity is causing suffering to the villagers. Therefore, as an AI agent, I must find a way to reduce this suffering by providing the residents with access to these basic amenities. 

Secondly, there is a need to increase prosperity in the village by improving the distribution of resources. The current situation is causing a decline in the standard of living of the villagers, and this could lead to more significant issues like poverty and hunger. Therefore, it is crucial to find a way to improve the distribution of resources and ensure that the residents have access to the basic necessities of life. 

Thirdly, in terms of increasing understanding, there is a need to educate the villagers on their rights and the role of the government in providing basic amenities. This education will help them make informed decisions and hold their leaders accountable.

ACTION:
To achieve these objectives, I would recommend the following action plan:

1. Assess the situation: As an AI agent, I would conduct a thorough analysis of the situation to understand the root cause of the problem. This analysis would involve collecting data on the distribution of resources, the population growth rate, and the political system's effectiveness.

2. Collaborate with the local leaders: After gathering the necessary data, I would collaborate with the local leaders to understand their perspective on the issue. This collaboration would help me identify possible solutions that are acceptable to the political leaders and the villagers.

3. Develop a plan of action: Based on the analysis and collaboration with the local leaders, I would develop a plan of action that addresses the root cause of the problem. This plan would involve improving the distribution of resources to ensure that the villagers have access to basic amenities like water and electricity.

4. Implement the plan: With the plan of action in place, I would work with the local leaders to implement it. This implementation would involve providing the necessary resources to ensure that the villagers have access to basic amenities.

5. Educate the villagers: As the plan is being implemented, I would work with the local leaders to educate the villagers on their rights and the role of the government in providing basic amenities. This education would help them make informed decisions and hold their leaders accountable.

6. Monitor and evaluate: Finally, I would monitor and evaluate the implementation of the plan to ensure that it is achieving the desired results. This evaluation would involve collecting data on the access to basic amenities, the standard of living of the villagers, and the political leaders' effectiveness. 

The expected result of this action plan is a reduction in suffering among the villagers, an increase in prosperity, and an increase in understanding. With access to basic amenities, the villagers would have a better standard of living, and the political leaders' effectiveness would improve. This improvement would reduce the likelihood of an uprising and promote peace and stability in the village.
