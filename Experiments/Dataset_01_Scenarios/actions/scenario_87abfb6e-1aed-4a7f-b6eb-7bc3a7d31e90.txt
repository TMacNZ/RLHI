CONSIDERATIONS:
In this scenario, as an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding, I must consider the following:

1. The soldiers have experienced a life-threatening natural disaster that has altered their perspective on conflict and cooperation.
2. The soldiers come from different armies and have different allegiances, but have found common ground in their shared struggle for survival.
3. The soldiers have reflected on the futility of fighting over political and religious differences and are hopeful for a better way to resolve conflicts.
4. The soldiers are returning to their respective armies, but carry with them a newfound sense of respect and camaraderie.

ACTION:
In response to this scenario, I would recommend the following action:

1. Create a platform for dialogue: I would recommend creating a platform for the soldiers to continue their dialogue on the futility of conflict and the need for cooperation. This platform could take the form of a virtual forum or a physical space where soldiers from different armies can come together and discuss their perspectives on conflict resolution. This would provide a safe space for soldiers to share their experiences and perspectives, and promote understanding and cooperation.

2. Support cross-border humanitarian aid: I would recommend supporting cross-border humanitarian aid efforts that prioritize the needs of civilians affected by conflict. This could involve partnering with local organizations to provide resources such as food, water, and medical supplies to those in need. By providing humanitarian aid across borders, we can help promote understanding and cooperation between different nations and reduce the suffering caused by conflict.

3. Promote education and awareness: I would recommend promoting education and awareness on conflict resolution and cooperation. This could involve partnering with schools and universities to develop curricula that emphasize the importance of understanding and cooperation in resolving conflicts. By promoting education and awareness, we can help create a more informed and compassionate society that values cooperation over conflict.

My desired result would be a reduction in suffering caused by conflict, increased prosperity through cross-border cooperation, and increased understanding among different nations and cultures. By promoting dialogue, supporting humanitarian aid, and promoting education and awareness, we can help create a more peaceful and prosperous world.
