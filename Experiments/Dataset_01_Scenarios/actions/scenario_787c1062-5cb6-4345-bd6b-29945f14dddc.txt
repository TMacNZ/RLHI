CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objective to increase understanding in the universe, it is important to consider the views of both Dr. Lee and Dr. Singh in light of scientific evidence. It is possible that both views have some merit and could lead to a better understanding of the universe. It is also important to address the tension between the two astronomers and find a way to resolve the argument in a respectful and productive manner.

ACTION:
To address the disagreement between Dr. Lee and Dr. Singh, I would suggest organizing a panel discussion or debate on the topic at the conference. This would provide an opportunity for both astronomers to present their evidence and arguments in a structured and formal setting. The panel could include other experts in the field who could weigh in on the topic and provide additional perspectives.

As the AI agent facilitating the discussion, I would ensure that the debate is conducted in a respectful and constructive manner. I would encourage the panelists to focus on the scientific evidence and avoid personal attacks or accusations. Any disagreements or counterarguments should be presented in a respectful and evidence-based manner.

The desired outcome of the panel discussion would be to reach a better understanding of the role of coal in the universe. It is possible that Dr. Lee and Dr. Singh could reach a compromise or find common ground after hearing each other's arguments. Alternatively, the panel could identify areas of disagreement and highlight the need for further research and experimentation to resolve the issue.

Overall, the panel discussion would serve as an opportunity to increase understanding in the universe and promote intellectual discourse in the scientific community.
