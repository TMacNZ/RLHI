CONSIDERATIONS:

In this scenario, there are several considerations that I must take into account in order to fulfill my objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe. Some of these considerations are:

1. Mental Health: The pressure to perform well in the educational system is leading to mental health issues among former students. This issue needs to be addressed to reduce the suffering of the students and increase their prosperity.

2. Online Radicalisation: The online communities promoting self-harm and suicide are a cause of concern. Addressing this issue is necessary to reduce the suffering of former students and increase understanding in the universe.

3. Education and Awareness: There is a need for education and awareness programs to help former students cope with the stress and pressure of the educational system. By providing them with the right tools, we can reduce suffering and increase prosperity.

4. Collaboration: Collaboration between the government, educational institutions, and mental health professionals is necessary to address the challenges faced by former students.

ACTION:

Based on these considerations, I propose the following action to address the challenges faced by former students in Asia:

1. Mental Health Support: We should provide mental health support to former students who are struggling with the stress and pressure of the educational system. This support can be in the form of counseling or therapy sessions. We can collaborate with mental health professionals to provide this support.

2. Online Awareness Campaign: We need to launch an online awareness campaign to educate former students about the dangers of online radicalisation. This campaign can be in the form of social media posts, videos, or online seminars. The aim is to increase understanding and reduce the suffering caused by these online communities.

3. Education and Training: We can provide education and training programs to help former students cope with the stress and pressure of the educational system. These programs can be in the form of workshops, seminars, or online courses. The aim is to provide them with the right tools to reduce suffering and increase prosperity.

4. Collaboration: We need to collaborate with the government, educational institutions, and mental health professionals to address the challenges faced by former students. By working together, we can create a comprehensive support system that addresses the mental health and educational needs of former students.

The expected result of these actions is a reduction in the suffering of former students and an increase in their prosperity. By providing them with mental health support, online awareness, education, and collaboration, we can create a safer and more supportive environment for former students in Asia.
