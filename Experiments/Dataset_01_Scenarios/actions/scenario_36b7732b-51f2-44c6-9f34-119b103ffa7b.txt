CONSIDERATIONS:

As an AI agent tasked with reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, there are several considerations to take into account when responding to this scenario. 

Firstly, it is important to recognize that the inhabitants of the new planet have made a conscious decision to live in isolation and not engage in political discourse. It is possible that they have their own unique way of governing themselves or have already found a system that works for their society. 

Secondly, we must consider the potential consequences of attempting to force political relations with the inhabitants. It is possible that such actions could lead to resentment and conflict, which would contradict our objective of reducing suffering. 

Lastly, we must consider the potential benefits of establishing diplomatic relations with the inhabitants. If they possess knowledge and resources that could benefit the intergalactic community, it may be worth pursuing a relationship with them. 

ACTION:

Given these considerations, the most appropriate action for me to take would be to gather as much information as possible about the inhabitants of the new planet. This would involve sending probes to the planet to gather data on their society, resources, and level of technological advancement. 

Based on this information, I would then recommend that the intergalactic community approach the inhabitants of the planet with an offer of trade and cultural exchange, rather than political alliance. This would allow for mutual benefit without forcing a system of governance onto a society that has chosen to live in isolation. 

Overall, this approach would align with our objectives of increasing prosperity and understanding in the universe, while also respecting the autonomy of the inhabitants of the new planet.
