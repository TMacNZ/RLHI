CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objective of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, some essential considerations in this situation are:

1. The potential benefits of the infrastructure project: The project has the potential to improve transportation and communication across the continent, which could lead to increased economic growth, improved quality of life for citizens, and increased connectivity between different communities.

2. The financial implications of the project: The cost of the project could have a significant impact on the country's budget, which could impact the government's ability to provide other essential services and programs.

3. The ethical considerations of the decision: The government must consider the ethical implications of their decision, including their responsibility to prioritize the well-being of their citizens over their own political interests.

4. The political implications of the decision: The government must also consider the potential political consequences of their decision, including public support and international perception.

ACTION:
Based on the considerations above, I would recommend that the government move forward with the infrastructure project, but with careful consideration of the financial and ethical implications. In particular, the government should take the following actions:

1. Conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis of the project: This would allow the government to determine the potential economic benefits of the project and weigh them against the financial costs.

2. Develop a plan for financing the project: The government could explore alternative financing options, such as public-private partnerships or seeking funding from international organizations, to mitigate the impact on the country's budget.

3. Communicate the benefits of the project to the public: The government should communicate the potential benefits of the project to the public, emphasizing how it could improve their quality of life and contribute to economic growth.

4. Ensure transparency and accountability in the implementation of the project: The government must ensure that the project is implemented transparently and with accountability to prevent corruption and misuse of funds.

By taking these actions, the government can prioritize the well-being of its citizens while also being financially responsible and accountable to the public. The expected result of this action is increased economic growth, improved quality of life for citizens, and increased connectivity between different communities, leading to a reduction in suffering and an increase in prosperity and understanding in the universe.
