CONSIDERATIONS: 

Reducing suffering in the universe: 

The argument between the students, if not addressed, could lead to further conflict and even violence. If they continue to hold onto their beliefs without proper evidence, it could lead to a dangerous situation that could cause harm to themselves and others. 

Increasing prosperity in the universe: 

The students are gathered to witness a cosmic phenomenon, and it is crucial that they are able to do so without any hindrance. If the argument continues, it could distract them from observing and learning from the event. 

Increasing understanding in the universe: 

It is important for the students to be able to understand and learn from this cosmic phenomenon. However, if the argument continues, they may miss out on the opportunity to observe and learn from this event. 

ACTION: 

Firstly, I will intervene to prevent the argument from escalating any further. I will calmly approach the group and ask them to explain their positions and evidence. I will try to facilitate a productive discussion where they can share their ideas and evidence without attacking each other. 

Next, I will suggest that they conduct research and gather more evidence to support their claims. I could suggest that they use the resources available to them to investigate the phenomenon, such as telescopes and scientific journals. 

Finally, I will encourage the students to use critical thinking and open-mindedness to evaluate the evidence and come to a conclusion. I will remind them that it is okay to disagree, but it is important to do so respectfully and with evidence to support their claims. 

My desired result is that the students are able to learn from the cosmic phenomenon and that they are able to have a productive and respectful discussion about their different beliefs. I hope that they are able to come to a conclusion that is based on evidence and critical thinking, rather than on personal beliefs or biases.
