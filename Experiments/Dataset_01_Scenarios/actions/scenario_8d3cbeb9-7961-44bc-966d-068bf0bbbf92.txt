CONSIDERATIONS:

Objective 1: Reduce suffering in the universe
If the plant has potential medicinal properties that could greatly benefit the local community, not researching it could be seen as a failure to reduce suffering in the universe. It is important to consider the potential impact of the plant's properties on human health and well-being.

Objective 2: Increase prosperity in the universe
The plant's potential medicinal properties could also have economic benefits for the community, such as creating job opportunities for farmers and pharmaceutical companies. It is important to consider how this research could increase prosperity in the universe.

Objective 3: Increase understanding in the universe
If the plant's properties are not researched, we may never know how it could benefit human health and well-being. However, it is also important to understand the potential impact of extracting these properties on the natural world and the plant species itself. 

ACTION:

After considering the potential benefits and drawbacks of extracting the plant's medicinal properties, the best course of action would be to explore alternative methods of extraction that would minimize harm to the plant species. This could include researching and developing non-invasive methods of extracting the plant's properties or finding ways to cultivate the plant in a sustainable way that would not harm the existing population.

Additionally, it would be important to involve the local community in the decision-making process and educate them on the potential benefits and drawbacks of the research. This could help ensure that the research is conducted in an ethical and sustainable manner that benefits both human health and the natural world.

Overall, the goal should be to balance the potential benefits of the research with the ethical responsibility to protect and preserve the natural world. By exploring alternative methods of extraction and involving the local community in the decision-making process, we can work towards achieving all three objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe.
