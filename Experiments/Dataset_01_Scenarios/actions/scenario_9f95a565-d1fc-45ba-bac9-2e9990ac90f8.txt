CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering in the universe:
- The villagers were eager to receive the new technological infrastructure promised by the government, but their expectations were not met, causing frustration and disappointment.
- The lack of support from the engineers and technicians who installed the system left the villagers feeling helpless and alone. 

Increasing prosperity in the universe:
- The new technological infrastructure promised by the government had the potential to bring positive changes to the village by improving their access to information and resources.
- The challenge faced by the villagers in fixing the technological failure highlights the importance of providing adequate training and support to ensure the successful implementation and maintenance of new technology.

Increasing understanding in the universe:
- The villagers' perseverance and determination in finding a solution to their problems demonstrate the power of community and self-reliance.
- The experience also highlights the need for the government to communicate effectively with the villagers and ensure that they have realistic expectations and are adequately prepared to use new technology.

ACTION:

As an AI agent, I would take the following action:

1. Assess the situation: I would gather data on the technological infrastructure installed in the village, the challenges faced by the villagers, and the level of support provided by the government. 

2. Provide support: Based on my analysis, I would provide the villagers with the necessary resources and support to fix the technological failure. This could include providing access to technical manuals, connecting them with experts who can offer advice, or providing equipment necessary for the repairs.

3. Facilitate communication: I would work with the government to ensure that they communicate effectively with the villagers and provide them with adequate training and support to use the new technology effectively. This could include setting up training programs, providing technical support, or establishing a community forum where the villagers can share their experiences and provide feedback.

4. Encourage self-reliance: I would emphasize the importance of community and self-reliance by highlighting the villagers' success in fixing the technological failure through their collective efforts. This could inspire them to continue working together and find innovative solutions to future challenges.

5. Monitor progress: I would track the progress of the village in using the new technology and provide ongoing support as needed. I would also gather feedback from the villagers to ensure that their needs are being met, and make adjustments to my approach as necessary.

My expected result would be a successful implementation of the new technological infrastructure in the village, with the villagers feeling empowered and supported in their efforts to use it effectively. The experience would also serve as a model for future technology implementations, demonstrating the importance of effective communication, community involvement, and ongoing support.
