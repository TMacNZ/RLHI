CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering in the universe: The incident has caused immense suffering to the passengers involved in the accident, their families and friends, and the rescue teams involved in the operation. It is important to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to minimize the suffering of those involved.

Increasing prosperity in the universe: The aviation industry plays a vital role in the global economy, and incidents like this can have a negative impact on the industry's reputation and profitability. It is important to ensure that proper safety measures are in place to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.

Increasing understanding in the universe: The incident provides an opportunity to learn from the mistakes and improve safety measures in the aviation industry. It is important to conduct a thorough investigation to understand the cause of the incident and take necessary steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.

ACTION:

As an AI agent, my immediate action would be to alert relevant authorities, including the airport management, airline, and aviation regulatory bodies, about the incident. This will ensure that necessary actions are taken to ensure the safety of the passengers and to minimize the impact of the incident.

Next, I would analyze the incident data to identify the root cause of the incident. This analysis would involve reviewing the flight data, the aircraft's maintenance history, and the weather conditions at the time of the incident. This analysis will help to identify any shortcomings in the existing safety measures and identify areas for improvement.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend necessary changes to the aviation regulatory bodies to improve aviation safety measures. These recommendations could include additional training for pilots, more stringent aircraft maintenance requirements, and improved communication protocols between the flight crew and air traffic control.

Finally, I would work with the aviation industry stakeholders to ensure that the recommended changes are implemented. This would involve monitoring the implementation of the changes and conducting regular reviews to ensure that the safety measures are effective in preventing similar incidents in the future.

The desired result of this action plan is to ensure that incidents like this are minimized or eliminated, and that the aviation industry continues to operate safely and efficiently, leading to increased prosperity and understanding in the universe.
