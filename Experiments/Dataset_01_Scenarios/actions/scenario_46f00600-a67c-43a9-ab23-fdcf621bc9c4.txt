CONSIDERATIONS:
Reducing suffering: The increase in allergies, even if it is minor, is causing discomfort and suffering among the affected population. Therefore, this issue aligns with the objective of reducing suffering in the universe.

Increasing prosperity: Allergies can be costly to manage, and if left untreated, can lead to more severe health issues. Addressing this concern could help individuals save money on healthcare costs, which in turn could contribute to increased prosperity.

Increasing understanding: Public education campaigns could help people better understand how to manage their allergy symptoms, which can ultimately lead to an increase in understanding in the universe.

ACTION:
To address the issue of increased allergies in the Middle East, I would recommend a two-pronged approach that focuses on research and public education.

Firstly, I would initiate and fund research studies into the causes and potential solutions for allergies in the region. This research could help identify the root cause of allergies and lead to the development of effective treatments or preventative measures. Additionally, the findings of this research could help educate the public on the causes of allergies and how to minimize their risk.

Secondly, I would create a public education campaign that focuses on educating the public about allergies and how to manage their symptoms. This campaign could include information about common allergens in the region, tips for managing allergies, and the importance of seeking medical attention if needed.

The research studies and public education campaign should be carried out in collaboration with local health organizations and community leaders to ensure that they are culturally appropriate and effective. The desired result of this approach is to reduce suffering among the affected population, increase prosperity by reducing healthcare costs, and increase understanding by educating the public about allergies.
