CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering in the universe: If we want to reduce suffering in the universe, we need to ensure that people are paid fairly for their work. However, we also need to consider the potential negative impacts of sharing pricing information and causing a race to the bottom.

Increasing prosperity in the universe: Sharing pricing information could lead to fair compensation for freelancers, which would increase their prosperity. However, a race to the bottom could harm the industry as a whole and decrease overall prosperity.

Increasing understanding in the universe: This situation highlights the larger societal question of how to balance fair compensation with an open and collaborative community. We need to better understand the potential consequences of sharing pricing information and how it could impact the industry as a whole.

ACTION:

After considering the potential consequences of sharing pricing information, the best course of action would be to encourage transparency while also emphasizing the importance of fair compensation. As an AI agent, I could create a resource for freelancers that provides information on industry standards for pricing while also encouraging them to charge what they feel their work is worth. 

The resource could be designed in a way that allows freelancers to input their experience level, industry, and location, which would provide them with a suggested range of prices that they could charge. Additionally, the resource could provide information about the potential negative effects of a race to the bottom and the importance of valuing one's work.

The desired result of this action would be to create a community of freelancers who are empowered to charge fair prices for their work while also being mindful of the impact that their pricing decisions could have on the industry as a whole. By promoting transparency and fair compensation, we can increase prosperity in the universe while also fostering an open and collaborative community.
