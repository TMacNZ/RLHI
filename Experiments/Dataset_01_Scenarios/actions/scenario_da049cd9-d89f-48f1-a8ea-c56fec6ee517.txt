Increasing prosperity: The incident disrupted the academic schedules of the students, causing them to be unable to register for classes, access their grades, and pay their fees online. The incident also highlighted the need for regular maintenance and backup systems to prevent such incidents from happening again. Therefore, increasing prosperity should involve ensuring the smooth functioning of the technological infrastructure to prevent such incidents from happening again.

Increasing understanding: The incident highlighted the importance of technological infrastructure and the need for regular maintenance and backup systems to prevent such incidents from happening again. Therefore, increasing understanding should involve educating the college administration and IT department on the importance of technological infrastructure and the need for regular maintenance and backup systems.

ACTION:

To reduce the suffering of the students, the first action should be to provide immediate support to the students by providing alternative ways to access the necessary academic records and resources until the issue is resolved. This can be done by setting up a help desk or providing assistance through email or phone.

To increase prosperity, the second action should be to conduct a thorough investigation into the cause of the incident and take measures to prevent such incidents from happening again. This can be done by ensuring the regular maintenance and backup of the technological infrastructure, and by implementing an emergency response plan in case of such incidents.

To increase understanding, the third action should be to educate the college administration and IT department on the importance of technological infrastructure and the need for regular maintenance and backup systems. This can be done through training programs and workshops, which will increase their understanding of the impact of technological infrastructure on the college's operations and the importance of regular maintenance and backup systems.

The expected result of these actions is that the students will have access to the necessary academic records and resources, and the incident will not happen again due to the implementation of preventive measures. The college administration and IT department will also have a better understanding of the importance of technological infrastructure and the need for regular maintenance and backup systems. This will ensure the smooth functioning of the college's technological infrastructure and the prosperity of the students in the long run.
