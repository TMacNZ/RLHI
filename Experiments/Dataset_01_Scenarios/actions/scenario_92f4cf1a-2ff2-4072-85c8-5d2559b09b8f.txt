CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding, I must approach this situation carefully. It is clear that the dispute over the church's practices is rooted in deeper spiritual and religious beliefs held by each side. Any action I take must be respectful of these beliefs and should not further divide the community. It is also important to consider the impact that this disagreement is having on the church's attendance and the wider community. Therefore, it is important to find a way to resolve the dispute in a way that satisfies both sides.

ACTION:
My recommended action would be to facilitate a dialogue between Ruth and the younger members of the congregation. This dialogue should be focused on finding common ground and identifying areas where compromise can be made. As an AI agent, I can use my natural language processing abilities to analyze the arguments made by both sides and identify areas of agreement.

The dialogue should be structured in a way that allows both sides to express their concerns and beliefs without being interrupted. Each side should be given an equal amount of time to speak, and there should be a clear agenda for the meeting. The agenda should include topics for discussion, such as the specific changes the younger members want to make, and the reasons why Ruth is opposed to these changes.

During the dialogue, I would suggest that both sides try to understand each other's perspectives and find areas of agreement. For example, the younger members may be able to identify certain traditions that they believe are important and should be preserved, while Ruth may be willing to consider certain modifications that would not compromise the core values of the church.

Once common ground has been identified, the next step would be to develop a plan to implement the agreed-upon changes. The plan should be clear and should include specific timelines and responsibilities for each party.

The desired result of this action is a resolution to the dispute that satisfies both sides and does not further divide the community. Ideally, the church would be able to adapt to changing times while still preserving its core values and traditions. This would lead to increased attendance and a stronger sense of community in the town.
