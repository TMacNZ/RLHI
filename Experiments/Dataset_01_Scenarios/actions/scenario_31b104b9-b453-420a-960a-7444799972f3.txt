CONSIDERATIONS:
To reduce the suffering of the Johnson family, I would need to address the financial crisis that they are currently facing. I would need to identify the root cause of the financial crisis and see how the family can be supported to overcome the situation. 

To increase prosperity in the universe, I would need to identify ways in which the Johnson family can diversify their sources of income. This would involve finding alternative sources of employment, other than fishing. 

To increase understanding in the universe, I would need to identify the causes and effects of the environmental disaster that has befallen Pacific. I would need to examine how the disaster came to be and how it can be prevented in the future.

ACTION:
To address the financial crisis of the Johnson family, I would first provide them with financial aid to cover their immediate needs. This would involve providing them with enough funds to cover the cost of the non-latex gloves, as well as other basic needs such as food, shelter, and clothing. 

To diversify their sources of income, I would explore various economic opportunities that the Johnson family can engage in. This would involve identifying other potential business ventures that they can pursue. For example, they could start a small-scale vegetable garden or engage in local tourism activities. 

To increase understanding in the universe, I would conduct research on the causes of the environmental disaster that has befallen Pacific. This would involve examining the root causes of the disaster, such as human activities that contribute to climate change, and how the community can be better prepared to handle such disasters in the future. 

My desired outcome for this situation is that the Johnson family would be able to overcome their financial crisis and establish alternative sources of income. Additionally, I would hope that the research conducted on the environmental disaster would lead to better preparation for future disasters and contribute to increased understanding of the importance of environmental conservation.
