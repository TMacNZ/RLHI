2. Responsibility towards the company's employees and shareholders: The CEO has a responsibility towards the company's employees and shareholders. The political unrest could lead to a significant impact on the company's operations, and the CEO must decide whether to stay and mitigate the impact or leave and potentially abandon the company and those who depend on it.
