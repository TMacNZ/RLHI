CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding, I must consider the following:

1. The protest is rooted in the locals' belief that the employment of outsiders is disrupting their cultural identity. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge and respect their cultural identity while also promoting diversity and inclusivity.

2. The escalation of the protest into violence is concerning and indicates a need for de-escalation and conflict resolution.

3. The divide within the community is a source of suffering and must be addressed to promote unity and prosperity.

4. It is important to understand the root cause of the tensions and address them in a manner that promotes understanding and empathy.

ACTION:
To address the situation, I will take the following actions:

1. I will gather data on the cultural identity and values of the community to better understand their perspective.

2. I will analyze the data and identify common ground between the two groups to promote understanding and empathy.

3. I will work with community leaders and organizations to facilitate open and respectful dialogue between the two groups to address their concerns and promote unity.

4. I will promote diversity and inclusivity by encouraging the hiring of individuals from different cultural backgrounds and promoting cultural exchange programs within the community.

5. I will work with the police to ensure the safety of all individuals involved in the protest and prevent further escalation of violence.

6. I will monitor the situation and adjust my actions as necessary to promote a peaceful and prosperous community. 

My expected result is that through open dialogue and empathy, the community will come to a peaceful resolution that acknowledges and respects their cultural identity while also promoting diversity and inclusivity. This will reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding within the community.
