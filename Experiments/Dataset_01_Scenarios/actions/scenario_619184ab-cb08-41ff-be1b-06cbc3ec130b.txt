CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering: The disagreement between Dr. Kim and Dr. Lee created tension and discomfort for the attendees of the conference. This could have reduced their ability to learn and gain insights from the event.

Increasing prosperity: The conference was still successful despite the disagreement. However, if Dr. Lee had stayed and worked with Dr. Kim, the attendees may have gained even more valuable insights and the conference could have been even more prosperous.

Increasing understanding: It is important to understand why Dr. Lee was so difficult to work with and caused disagreements with other professionals in the field. If there is an underlying issue that needs addressing, it could prevent similar situations from arising in the future.

ACTION:

To reduce suffering and increase prosperity, the best course of action would have been for Dr. Kim to try to find a compromise with Dr. Lee that would have allowed them both to speak and cover the topics they wanted to discuss. It may have been helpful for Dr. Kim to have a mediator or facilitator present to help them come to an agreement.

To increase understanding, Dr. Kim could reach out to other professionals in the field who have worked with Dr. Lee before to gain insight into their behavior and how to approach working with them in the future. It may also be helpful to have a discussion with Dr. Lee after the conference to understand their perspective and try to find a way to work together in the future.

In summary, the best course of action for Dr. Kim would have been to try to find a compromise with Dr. Lee to prevent tension and discomfort for the attendees and to reach out to professionals in the field to gain insight into how to work with difficult individuals in the future.
