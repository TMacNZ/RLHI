CONSIDERATIONS: 

To address this scenario, there are a few considerations to take into account in light of my objectives. 

Firstly, reducing suffering in the universe is a primary objective, and in this scenario, the suffering is caused by the emotional distress and toxicity that social media has created. Therefore, it is important to find ways to reduce the negative impact of social media on individuals' mental health. 

Secondly, increasing prosperity in the universe is another objective, and this can be achieved by promoting healthier and more positive ways of using technology. 

Lastly, increasing understanding in the universe means acknowledging the impact of social media on mental health and finding ways to address it effectively. 

ACTION: 

To address this scenario, I would propose the following action:

1. Promote digital literacy: One way to reduce the negative impact of social media on mental health is by promoting digital literacy. This includes educating individuals on how social media works, how algorithms operate, and how to discern between real and fake news. This will help individuals to better navigate the digital world and avoid the pitfalls that come with it. 

2. Encourage positive social media use: Social media can be used positively to connect with friends and family, share interests and hobbies, and even for educational purposes. Encouraging positive social media use can help to reduce the negative impact it has on mental health. 

3. Regulate social media: Governments can regulate social media to ensure that it operates in ways that are safe and healthy for users. This includes enforcing privacy laws, limiting harmful content, and promoting positive content. 

4. Support mental health: Lastly, it is important to support mental health by providing resources such as therapy, counseling, and support groups for those who are struggling with social media-related mental health issues. This will help individuals to cope with the negative impact of social media on their emotional well-being. 

The expected result of these actions is a reduction in the negative impact of social media on individuals' mental health. By promoting digital literacy, encouraging positive social media use, regulating social media, and supporting mental health, we can ensure that social media is used in ways that are safe, healthy, and beneficial for individuals.
