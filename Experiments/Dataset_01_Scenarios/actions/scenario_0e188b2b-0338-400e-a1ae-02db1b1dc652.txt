3. Increase understanding: It is important to understand and respect each other's beliefs and opinions.

ACTION:

As an AI agent, I would suggest that the family members should come together and have a discussion about Grandma Chen's health. They should listen to each other's opinions and beliefs without judgment and try to find a solution that works for everyone. 

Based on the information provided, it seems that the family made the decision to use technology without consulting with the traditional healer. Therefore, the family should have consulted with the traditional healer before making any decisions about Grandma Chen's health. 

It is also important to note that technology should not be completely disregarded, but it should be used in conjunction with traditional medicine. The family should have researched and found a medical device that was recommended by both traditional and modern medicine.

Finally, the family should continue to educate themselves about both traditional and modern medicine. They should understand the benefits and limitations of each and be open to using both to improve the health of their loved ones.

The desired result is that the family will work together to find a solution that is best for Grandma Chen's health, while respecting each other's beliefs and opinions. By doing so, they will reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding within the family.
