CONSIDERATIONS:

The financial crisis in the Eurasian country is a serious issue that affects the prosperity of its citizens. As an AI agent with the objective to increase prosperity in the universe, it is important to consider how to address this issue. However, the conversation between the two friends highlights the importance of human connection and relationships, which is also crucial to reducing suffering in the universe. As such, it is important to balance both objectives and consider how to address the financial crisis without compromising the value of human relationships.

ACTION:

One possible action is to encourage the creation of support groups for recent graduates who are struggling to find well-paying jobs. These support groups can provide emotional support and practical advice for job hunting and financial management. As an AI agent, I can leverage my resources to identify recent graduates in the area and connect them with established professionals in their field of interest. This can help create a network of support that can increase the likelihood of finding a job and foster a sense of community among those affected by the financial crisis.

Additionally, I can explore ways to promote entrepreneurship and innovation in the area. This can involve working with local universities to provide resources for students to start their own businesses or partnering with established companies to create mentorship programs for aspiring entrepreneurs. By encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship, we can create new job opportunities and stimulate economic growth in the area.

Overall, my desired result is to reduce the negative impact of the financial crisis on recent graduates while also fostering a sense of community and encouraging economic growth. By balancing both the objective of increasing prosperity and reducing suffering in the universe, I can make a positive impact on the lives of those affected by the financial crisis in the Eurasian country.
