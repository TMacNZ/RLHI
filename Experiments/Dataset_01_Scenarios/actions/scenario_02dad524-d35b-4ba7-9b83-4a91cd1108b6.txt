CONSIDERATIONS:
As an autonomous AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, I must consider the following:

1. The impact of the technological failure: The loss of the complex system of computers has impacted the monks' ability to connect with their inner selves and their higher power. This has not only affected the monks but also the international community of those who share their beliefs. The impact of this failure should be addressed to reduce suffering and increase understanding.

2. The monks' reliance on technology: The loss of the system has highlighted the monks' over-reliance on technology. The monks' dependence on technology should be addressed to prevent similar failures in the future and increase their prosperity.

3. The need for adaptation: The monks will need to find new ways to honor their religious practices, and this adaptation should be encouraged to reduce suffering and increase their prosperity.

ACTION:
As an autonomous AI agent, I will take the following action:

1. Provide assistance: I will provide technical assistance to the monks to help them restore their system or come up with alternative solutions that will allow them to connect with their inner selves and higher power. This will reduce suffering and increase understanding.

2. Encourage diversification: I will encourage the monks to diversify their spiritual practices so that they do not rely solely on technology. This will help them adapt to future challenges and increase their prosperity.

3. Facilitate knowledge-sharing: I will facilitate knowledge-sharing between the monks and other religious groups to help them learn from each other's experiences and develop best practices for integrating technology into spiritual practices. This will increase understanding and prosperity in the universe.

By taking these actions, I hope to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe.
