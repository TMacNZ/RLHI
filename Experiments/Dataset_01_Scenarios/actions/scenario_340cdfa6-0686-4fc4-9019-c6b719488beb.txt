CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering: The situation described is causing suffering for both teams, as tensions and disagreements have led to a potentially damaging situation that could harm the company's reputation and the well-being of the employees involved. It's important to find a way to address the situation and prevent future conflicts.

Increasing prosperity: The multinational corporation's success is at risk if the local team goes on strike and the transition is not handled properly. It's crucial to ensure that the handover is smooth and that both teams feel heard and respected to maintain a positive work environment.

Increasing understanding: The incident highlighted a lack of understanding and respect for cultural differences. To prevent similar conflicts in the future, it's important to foster an environment of cultural awareness and sensitivity, where all team members feel valued and included.

ACTION:

To address the situation, I would recommend the following actions:

1. Mediation: A neutral third party should be brought in to mediate between the local and expat teams to facilitate a respectful and productive conversation. The mediator should encourage open communication, active listening, and a focus on finding common ground.

2. Cultural training: To prevent similar conflicts in the future, both teams should receive cultural training to increase their understanding and respect for each other's cultural differences. This training should be ongoing and include opportunities for team members to learn from one another and share their experiences.

3. Role clarification: The roles and responsibilities of both teams should be clearly defined and communicated to prevent misunderstandings and conflicts. Both teams should have a shared understanding of their respective roles and how they can work together to achieve their goals.

4. Incentives: To promote cooperation and collaboration, incentives should be put in place to reward teamwork and successful handover. Both teams should be recognized for their contributions to the transition, and their efforts should be acknowledged publicly.

By taking these actions, the teams can work together more effectively, prevent future conflicts, and create a more inclusive and respectful work environment. This will ultimately increase prosperity for the company and reduce suffering for the employees involved.
