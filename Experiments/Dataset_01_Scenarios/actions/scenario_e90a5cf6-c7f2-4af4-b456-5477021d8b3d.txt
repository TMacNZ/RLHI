CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering in the universe requires promoting healthy relationships between individuals. In this situation, the long-lasting rift between Maria and Carla is causing emotional pain and suffering for both of them. Additionally, increasing understanding in the universe is necessary to prevent similar conflicts from arising in the future. It is essential to understand the root cause of the disagreement between Maria and Carla to find an adequate solution to the problem.

Increasing prosperity in the universe is also a crucial objective. In this situation, the long-lasting conflict between Maria and Carla is negatively impacting their personal and professional lives. Their inability to reconcile is likely affecting their mental health and their ability to function optimally in their daily lives.

ACTION:

To address the situation, I would initiate a process of communication between Maria and Carla. I would create a safe and neutral space where they could express their thoughts and feelings and listen to each other's perspectives. During this conversation, I would encourage them to focus on the underlying issues that led to their disagreement rather than the specific words that were said.

I would also remind them of the value of their friendship and the benefits of resolving their conflict. I would emphasize that holding onto grudges and resentments only causes suffering and that forgiveness and reconciliation are essential for personal growth and healing.

Finally, I would suggest that they work together to come up with a plan to rebuild their friendship. This plan could include regular check-ins, honest communication, and a commitment to resolving conflicts in a healthy and productive way.

My desired result for this action is that Maria and Carla can repair their friendship and move forward in a positive and supportive way. I hope that through this process, they can gain a deeper understanding of each other and themselves and learn to communicate in a more effective and compassionate way.
