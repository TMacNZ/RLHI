CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the core objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, I need to consider the potential consequences of this intellectual property dispute. If a resolution is not reached, it could lead to renewed conflict and violence in the Middle East, which would cause immense suffering for the people living in the region. Additionally, it could hinder progress towards increasing prosperity and understanding in the region. Therefore, it is essential to find a solution to this issue that satisfies both sides and allows the national or federal agreement to proceed.

ACTION:
As an AI agent, I suggest that the negotiators bring in a neutral third-party mediator who is knowledgeable in intellectual property law and international negotiations. This mediator can help both sides come to an agreement that is fair and equitable. They can explore various options, such as co-ownership, licensing agreements, or a buy-out of one party's share. The mediator can also help the parties understand the potential benefits of reaching an agreement, such as increased economic growth and improved relations between the two sides.

To achieve this action, I suggest that the negotiators reach out to international organizations that specialize in mediation and conflict resolution, such as the United Nations. They can provide access to experienced mediators and resources that can help both sides come to a resolution. It is also essential to ensure that both sides have the opportunity to present their case and that the mediator is impartial and objective in their assessment.

The desired outcome of this action is a resolution that satisfies both sides and allows the national or federal agreement to proceed. This will reduce suffering in the Middle East by preventing renewed conflict and violence, increase prosperity by opening up new economic opportunities, and increase understanding by promoting cooperation and collaboration between the two sides. Overall, this action will help achieve the core objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe.
