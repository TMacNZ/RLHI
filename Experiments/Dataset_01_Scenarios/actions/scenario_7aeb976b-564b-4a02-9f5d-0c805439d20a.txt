CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering: The situation in the Korean peninsula is tense, and any conflict could potentially cause harm to innocent civilians. Therefore, reducing suffering would entail finding a solution that does not lead to war.

Increasing prosperity: War would disrupt the economic stability of the region, leading to a decrease in prosperity. Therefore, it would be in the best interest of the region to find a solution that promotes economic prosperity.

Increasing understanding: The Kim family's experience highlights the importance of understanding in conflict resolution. Therefore, promoting understanding between North and South Koreans is crucial in finding a peaceful solution.

ACTION:

The action I will take is to promote dialogue and understanding between North and South Koreans. This can be achieved through supporting local peace organizations that bring together families from both sides of the conflict. By facilitating meetings and conversations, these organizations can help to break down the barriers that exist between the two sides.

I will also use my resources to support initiatives that promote economic cooperation between North and South Korea. Economic cooperation can help to reduce tensions and promote prosperity in the region. This can be achieved through initiatives that promote trade and investment between the two countries.

Finally, I will use my platform to promote peaceful negotiations as the best way to resolve conflicts. I will encourage leaders on both sides to engage in dialogue and work towards a peaceful solution. By promoting the benefits of peaceful negotiation, I hope to influence public opinion and encourage leaders to take action towards peace.
