ACTION:

Kim should approach her boss and explain the situation, highlighting the potential harm that could be caused if the software is released without disclosing the hidden code. She should present her concerns respectfully and professionally, focusing on the ethical implications of the situation. 

Kim could suggest that they work together to address the issue before presenting the software to potential clients. This could involve disclosing the hidden code to the clients and presenting a plan to address the issue. 

If her boss refuses to address the issue, Kim should escalate the situation to a higher authority within the company. She could also consider reporting the issue to a regulatory body if she believes that the company's actions could result in harm to users of the software.

The desired result of this action is for the company to act ethically and responsibly by disclosing the hidden code to potential clients and addressing the issue before releasing the software. This will ensure that the users of the software are protected and that the company maintains its reputation and long-term prosperity.
