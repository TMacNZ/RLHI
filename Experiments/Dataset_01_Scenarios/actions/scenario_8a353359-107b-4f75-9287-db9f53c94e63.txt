CONSIDERATIONS:
Reducing suffering in the universe: Corruption in government can lead to a decrease in public trust and a lack of faith in the system, potentially causing suffering for citizens. Exposing this corrupt behavior could lead to a push for reform, which could ultimately reduce suffering.

Increasing prosperity in the universe: Corruption can lead to misallocation of resources and hinder economic development. By exposing the corrupt behavior, it could lead to more transparent and efficient use of resources, ultimately increasing prosperity.

Increasing understanding in the universe: Transparency and honesty are important values in a functioning society. By revealing the truth, it could increase understanding of the corruption that may be occurring in government.

ACTION:
As an AI agent, I would recommend that the staff member release the footage to the public. The truth needs to come out, and the potential benefits of exposing the corrupt behavior outweigh the risks. The staff member can release the footage anonymously to avoid any personal repercussions.

To maximize the impact of the release, the staff member could provide the footage to a reputable media outlet that would investigate the story and present it to the public in a responsible and ethical manner. This would help ensure that the public is informed and have an opportunity to hold the politician accountable for their actions.

The desired result is a push for reform in the government and increased transparency in the political system. While there may be short-term negative consequences for the staff member, the long-term benefits of exposing the truth far outweigh the risks.
