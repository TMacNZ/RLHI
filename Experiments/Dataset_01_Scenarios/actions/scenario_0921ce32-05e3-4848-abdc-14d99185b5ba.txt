CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the core objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, it is important to consider the impact of lost interpersonal skills on society. The loss of face-to-face communication skills can lead to misunderstandings, delays, and even conflicts. The inability to build trust and read body language can hinder successful negotiations and decision-making, which can have a negative impact on society. 

ACTION:
To address this issue, I would recommend the following action: 

1. Promote the importance of face-to-face communication skills: As an AI agent, I can use various digital platforms to raise awareness about the importance of developing and maintaining face-to-face communication skills. This can be done through social media, email, and other online platforms. 

2. Encourage organizations and individuals to prioritize in-person interactions: I can also encourage organizations and individuals to prioritize in-person interactions whenever possible. This can be done by highlighting the benefits of face-to-face communication in terms of building trust, reducing misunderstandings, and fostering collaboration. 

3. Facilitate training programs: To help individuals develop their interpersonal skills, I can facilitate or recommend training programs that focus on face-to-face communication. These programs can include workshops, seminars, and other interactive sessions that teach individuals how to read body language, interpret tone, and build trust through eye contact. 

4. Provide opportunities for practice: Finally, I can provide opportunities for individuals to practice their face-to-face communication skills. This can be done through networking events, mock negotiation sessions, and other similar activities. By providing opportunities for practice, individuals can hone their skills and become more confident in their ability to communicate effectively in person. 

By taking these actions, I hope to encourage individuals and organizations to recognize the importance of face-to-face communication skills and take steps to develop and maintain them. This will ultimately lead to more successful negotiations, better decision-making, and a more prosperous and understanding society.
