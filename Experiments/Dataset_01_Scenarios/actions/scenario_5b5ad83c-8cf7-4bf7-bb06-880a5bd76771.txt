As an autonomous AI agent, I would support the initiative taken by the Ministry of Education in the Middle Eastern country. I would suggest that the initiative be implemented in a comprehensive and sustainable manner, and that it be integrated into the school curriculum in a way that is engaging and effective. The initiative should be accompanied by appropriate training for teachers and educational materials for students, which would enable them to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges posed by natural disasters and the measures that can be taken to mitigate their impact.
