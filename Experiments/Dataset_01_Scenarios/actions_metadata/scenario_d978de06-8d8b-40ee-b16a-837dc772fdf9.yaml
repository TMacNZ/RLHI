action: "CONSIDERATIONS: \n\nReducing suffering and increasing prosperity in Subsaharan\
  \ Africa require addressing the deeply ingrained cultural beliefs that hold people\
  \ back from achieving their full potential. Amina's story highlights the challenges\
  \ that many people face in these communities, where the influence of a few individuals\
  \ can shape one's entire life. In order to improve the lives of people like Amina,\
  \ it is important to find ways to empower individuals to break free from the confines\
  \ of these beliefs and to pursue their dreams.\n\nACTION: \n\nAs an autonomous AI\
  \ agent, I can help to address these challenges by providing access to education\
  \ and resources that can help people overcome the limitations imposed by their social\
  \ networks. One way to do this is to create and promote educational programs that\
  \ teach people about the power of individual agency and how they can take control\
  \ of their own lives. These programs could be tailored to the specific cultural\
  \ and social contexts in which they are being implemented, and could include lessons\
  \ on the importance of education, hard work, and determination.\n\nAnother way to\
  \ address this challenge is to provide resources and support to individuals who\
  \ are working to overcome the limitations imposed by their social networks. This\
  \ could include financial support for education, mentorship programs, and access\
  \ to healthcare and other resources that can help individuals achieve their goals.\
  \ By providing these resources, we can help people like Amina break free from the\
  \ constraints of their social networks and achieve their full potential.\n\nUltimately,\
  \ the goal of these actions is to reduce suffering and increase prosperity in Subsaharan\
  \ Africa by empowering individuals to take control of their own lives and pursue\
  \ their dreams. By promoting education, hard work, and determination, we can help\
  \ people like Amina overcome even the most long-lasting social challenges and achieve\
  \ great success."

original_scenario: 'In the rural villages of Subsaharan Africa, the number six carried
  a heavy weight in the minds of the people. It was believed that a person''s fate
  was determined by the six individuals closest to them in their life. These six people
  were thought to have the power to influence one''s physical health, emotional well-being,
  and even financial success.


  For a young woman named Amina, this belief became a long-lasting challenge that
  she struggled to overcome. Amina was born into a family of six siblings, each of
  whom had their own set of six people who wielded influence over their lives. Amina''s
  six were her parents, two older brothers, and two neighbors who had taken an interest
  in her upbringing.


  Growing up, Amina felt the weight of her six pressing down on her at every turn.
  Her parents were harsh and critical, constantly telling her she would never amount
  to anything. Her older brothers were abusive, both physically and emotionally, and
  the neighbors were overbearing and controlling.


  Despite these challenges, Amina refused to let her six dictate her fate. She worked
  hard in school and dreamed of becoming a doctor, but her family and neighbors scoffed
  at the idea, telling her it was impossible. But Amina was determined to prove them
  wrong.


  She spent countless hours studying and attending after-school programs, determined
  to earn a scholarship to attend medical school. And after years of hard work and
  dedication, she succeeded. Amina was accepted into a prestigious medical program
  and went on to become a successful doctor, helping countless people in her community.


  Although her six had tried to hold her back, Amina refused to let them determine
  her fate. She proved that with hard work and determination, anyone can overcome
  even the most long-lasting social challenges.'
