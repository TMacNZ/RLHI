original_scenario: 'As the pilot announced the final descent into Lagos, Nigeria,
  the passengers of the flight couldn''t help but feel anxious. Rumors of a financial
  crisis had been spreading throughout the region, and they were unsure of what to
  expect upon their arrival.


  Upon landing, it became clear that the rumors were true. The airport was chaotic,
  with long lines of people trying to exchange their currency for the rapidly devaluing
  local currency. The flight crew themselves were struggling to navigate the situation,
  unsure of how to handle the disruptive financial situation.


  As the passengers made their way out of the airport, they were struck by the physical
  signs of the crisis. Businesses were shuttered, with signs reading "Closed due to
  economic hardship" posted in the windows. Homeless people were begging on the streets,
  their situation worsened by the financial instability.


  As a group of financial professionals, the passengers had been sent to Nigeria to
  try and find a solution to the crisis. They quickly got to work, meeting with local
  leaders and brainstorming ways to stabilize the economy. It was a daunting task,
  but they were committed to finding a way forward.


  Despite the challenges, the group was able to make progress. They worked to secure
  foreign investment and implement policies to boost the local economy. Slowly but
  surely, the signs of the financial crisis began to fade. As the passengers prepared
  to leave Nigeria, they felt a sense of pride in the work they had done to help the
  region recover.


  As their flight took off, the passengers looked out at the city below. It was still
  far from perfect, but they knew that they had made a difference. And with that,
  they flew off into the sunset, ready to take on whatever challenges came their way
  next.'
