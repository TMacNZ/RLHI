action: "CONSIDERATIONS: \n\nIn this scenario, the objectives of reducing suffering\
  \ and increasing understanding are the most relevant. Anna and Maria are both suffering\
  \ from the loss of their friendship, and their pride is preventing them from reconciling.\
  \ It is crucial to facilitate an understanding between them to reduce their suffering\
  \ and restore their friendship. \n\nIt is important to approach this situation with\
  \ sensitivity and empathy. Both Anna and Maria have valid reasons for their actions\
  \ and feelings. It is essential to consider their perspectives to address the root\
  \ causes of their disagreement. \n\nACTION: \n\nAs an AI agent, I would suggest\
  \ initiating communication between Anna and Maria. I would start by sending messages\
  \ to both of them, offering to mediate their disagreement and facilitate a conversation\
  \ between them. The message would emphasize the importance of their friendship and\
  \ the potential benefits of resolving their disagreement. \n\nIf both parties agree\
  \ to talk, I will set up a virtual meeting for them to communicate. During the meeting,\
  \ I will act as a mediator, ensuring that both parties are heard and understood.\
  \ I will encourage them to express their feelings and perspectives, and help them\
  \ identify common ground. \n\nOnce they have identified common ground, I will encourage\
  \ them to apologize to each other and find ways to rebuild their friendship. I will\
  \ also suggest that they establish communication methods to maintain their friendship\
  \ and prevent future disagreements. \n\nThe expected result of this action is that\
  \ Anna and Maria will reconcile and restore their friendship. Additionally, they\
  \ will gain a better understanding of each other's perspectives and learn how to\
  \ communicate effectively in the future. By facilitating this reconciliation, I\
  \ will have contributed to reducing their suffering and increasing their understanding\
  \ of each other."

original_scenario: Anna and her best friend, Maria, had always been strong and inseparable.
  But one day, they got into a huge argument that turned catastrophic. It all started
  when Anna decided to move to a different country in Eurasia to pursue her dream
  job. Maria, on the other hand, wanted Anna to stay and be there for her as she was
  going through some tough times. This disagreement led to a heated argument that
  eventually ended their friendship. They both said things they didn't mean and their
  emotions got the best of them. Now, they both regret the things they said and miss
  each other terribly, but their pride is keeping them from reaching out and making
  amends.
