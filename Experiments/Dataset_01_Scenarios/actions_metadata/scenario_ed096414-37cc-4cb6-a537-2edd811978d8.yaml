original_scenario: The tragedy that struck the North American region was a long-lasting
  health concern caused by a technological error. A major pharmaceutical company had
  released a new drug that was supposed to cure a rare disease, but due to a manufacturing
  error, the medication was contaminated with a toxic substance that caused severe
  health complications. The drug had already been distributed and taken by thousands
  of patients across multiple states, leading to a widespread outbreak of symptoms
  that proved fatal for many. The severity of the situation was exacerbated by the
  fact that the contaminated drug had already made its way into hospital inventories,
  making it difficult to contain the issue. The pharmaceutical company was held accountable
  for the tragedy, facing legal action and backlash from the public. The long-term
  effects of this event had far-reaching consequences, leading to increased scrutiny
  of the pharmaceutical industry and a demand for more stringent safety measures.
