original_scenario: The extended family had been on a holiday in the beautiful South
  Pacific region for a week now. On a sunny afternoon, they decided to go for a swim
  in the ocean. As they were enjoying the warm water, they noticed a young man struggling
  to stay afloat. One of the family members, who was a trained lifeguard, immediately
  swam towards him to help. The young man, who turned out to be a recruit in the local
  navy, had been caught in a strong current and was unable to swim back to shore.
  He was emotional and scared, which made the rescue even more challenging. With the
  help of another family member, they were able to bring the recruit back to the shore
  safely. However, the incident left an emotional impact on everyone involved, especially
  the recruit who was grateful for their help. The family was reminded of the dangers
  of the ocean and the importance of being aware of their surroundings while enjoying
  their vacation.
