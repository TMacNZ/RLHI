original_scenario: The nuclear family of four had always been fascinated by rocks.
  They were on a vacation trip to the South Pacific, where they planned to explore
  different beaches and collect rocks. One fine day, while they were wandering on
  the beach and collecting rocks, they stumbled upon a strange looking rock. Upon
  closer inspection, they realized that it was a rare radioactive rock, which had
  the potential to cause a catastrophic event. The family now faced an ethical dilemma.
  Should they keep the rock as a prized collection, risking the lives of thousands
  of people in the region, or should they report it to the authorities and risk ruining
  their vacation and potentially facing legal consequences? As the parents were educators,
  they decided to use this as a learning opportunity for their children about the
  importance of ethical decision making. They took the rock to the authorities, who
  were able to safely dispose of it. The family was praised for their responsible
  actions, and they continued their vacation with a newfound appreciation for ethical
  decision making.
