action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering: The financial crisis has not only affected the company but also
  its employees, their families, and the wider community that depends on the business.
  Closing the business will result in job losses and have a detrimental impact on
  the local economy. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the impact of any decision
  on the stakeholders and minimize their suffering.


  Increasing prosperity: The current trend of supporting local businesses could be
  an opportunity for the company to re-strategize and tap into the local market. However,
  this will require significant investment and a change in business model, which may
  not be feasible given the current financial crisis.


  Increasing understanding: The shift in consumer behavior indicates a need for the
  company to understand and adapt to the changing market trends. It is essential to
  carry out market research and understand the needs and preferences of the target
  market.


  ACTION:


  After considering the objectives, I recommend that the company adopts a two-pronged
  approach that involves cutting costs and exploring new opportunities to increase
  revenue.


  Firstly, the company should reduce overhead costs by downsizing, renegotiating contracts,
  and implementing cost-cutting measures. This will help the company to stay afloat
  and meet its immediate financial obligations.


  Secondly, the company should explore new revenue streams by tapping into the local
  market. This could involve partnering with local businesses, offering local products,
  and providing personalized services that cater to the needs of the local market.
  The company should also invest in marketing and market research to understand the
  local market better.


  The above actions should be carried out in a phased approach, starting with cost-cutting
  measures and then gradually transitioning into exploring new opportunities. The
  success of this approach will depend on the company''s ability to adapt to the changing
  market trends, be innovative, and execute its plans effectively.


  The desired outcome of this approach is for the company to weather the storm and
  emerge stronger by tapping into the local market, reducing costs, and improving
  profitability. This will not only benefit the company but also its employees, their
  families, and the wider community.'

original_scenario: As the chief financial officer of a major online marketplace in
  Eurasia, you have been hit hard by a severe financial crisis that threatens the
  very existence of your company. The crisis has been caused by a philosophical shift
  in the way people view online transactions, with many consumers now preferring to
  support local businesses instead of buying from large, multinational corporations.
  This has led to a steep decline in sales for your company, and you are struggling
  to keep up with the mounting debts and dwindling resources. The situation has become
  life-threatening, and you are faced with the difficult decision of whether to try
  and weather the storm or to close your business for good. The stakes are high, and
  the future of your company hangs in the balance.
