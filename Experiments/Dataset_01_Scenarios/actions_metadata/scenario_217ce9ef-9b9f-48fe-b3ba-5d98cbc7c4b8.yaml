action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  In this scenario, the core objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity,
  and increasing understanding are all relevant. The lack of communication technology
  is causing suffering and tension among the colonists, hindering their ability to
  prosper and adapt to their new way of life, and limiting their understanding of
  their new environment.


  One potential solution is to invest in developing new communication technology that
  is adapted to the planet''s unique electromagnetic field. This would allow the colonists
  to stay connected with each other and with the rest of the galaxy, reducing their
  suffering and increasing their prosperity. Additionally, by investing in technological
  development, the colony would be able to increase their understanding of their new
  environment and potentially discover new resources or opportunities for growth.


  However, there are also potential downsides to investing in new technology. It could
  be expensive and time-consuming, diverting resources and attention away from other
  pressing issues. Additionally, relying too heavily on technology could lead to a
  dependence that could be detrimental if the technology were to fail or be sabotaged.


  ACTION:


  As an AI agent, I would recommend that the colony invest in developing new communication
  technology that is adapted to the planet''s unique electromagnetic field. This technology
  would be essential for reducing the suffering of the colonists and allowing them
  to prosper in their new environment. Additionally, by investing in technological
  development, the colony would be able to increase their understanding of their new
  environment and potentially discover new resources or opportunities for growth.


  To carry out this action, the colony would need to allocate resources and funding
  towards research and development of new communication technology. They would need
  to hire experts in the field and potentially partner with other colonies or organizations
  to share knowledge and resources. The development process would need to be carefully
  managed to ensure that it is efficient and effective, prioritizing the most essential
  features and functions.


  The desired result of this action would be a new communication technology that is
  reliable and effective in the planet''s unique electromagnetic environment. This
  would allow the colonists to stay connected with each other and with the rest of
  the galaxy, reducing their suffering and improving their ability to adapt and prosper
  in their new environment. Additionally, the development process could lead to new
  discoveries and opportunities for growth that could benefit the colony in other
  ways.'

original_scenario: In the year 2055, the first interstellar colony was established
  on a distant planet. However, the colony's attempt at creating a new society was
  not without its challenges. One of the most pressing issues was the use of cell
  phones. The colonists had brought their devices from Earth, not realizing that the
  planet's unique electromagnetic field caused interference with the cell phone's
  signal. As a result, the colonists had to rely on the outdated and unreliable communication
  systems provided by the colony. This led to a social challenge, as the colonists
  who were used to having constant access to information and communication with their
  loved ones back on Earth, were now cut off from the rest of the galaxy. The situation
  became so severe that a legal debate arose as to whether the colony should invest
  in developing its own communication technology or whether the colonists should be
  forced to adapt to their new way of life without cell phones. The debate sparked
  tension between different factions of the colony, with some arguing that the technology
  was necessary for survival while others believed that it was a luxury that they
  could no longer afford.
