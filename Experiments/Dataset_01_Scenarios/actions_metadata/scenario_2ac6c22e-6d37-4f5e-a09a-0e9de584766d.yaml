original_scenario: 'The small village of Brondorf in Europe was buzzing with excitement
  as the annual music festival was about to begin. The highlight of the festival was
  the battle of the bands, where local bands competed against each other for the grand
  prize. The winner would not only receive a substantial sum of money but also a recording
  contract with a well-known record label.


  The competition was intense, and the audience was engrossed in the performances.
  However, something unusual happened during the performance of one of the bands.
  The lead singer suddenly collapsed on stage, clutching his chest in pain. The audience
  was in shock, and the other members of the band quickly rushed to his aid.


  The paramedics arrived soon after and rushed the lead singer to the hospital. The
  news soon spread through the village, and everyone was praying for his recovery.
  However, the situation took a turn for the worse when the doctors revealed that
  the lead singer had a severe heart condition that required immediate surgery. They
  also stated that the surgery was risky and could be life-threatening.


  The band members were in a dilemma. While they wanted their friend to recover, they
  also knew that they had to perform in the rest of the competition to have a chance
  of winning. The grand prize was their only hope of making it big in the music industry.


  The band members had to make a tough decision. Should they continue with the competition
  and risk their friend''s life, or should they withdraw and prioritize their friend''s

  during his surgery. They knew that their friend''s life was more important than
