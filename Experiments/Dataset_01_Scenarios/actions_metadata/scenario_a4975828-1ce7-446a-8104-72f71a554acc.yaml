action: "CONSIDERATIONS: \n\nReducing suffering in the universe: Financial crises\
  \ can lead to a significant amount of suffering for the individuals and communities\
  \ affected by them. Therefore, preventing such crises can contribute to reducing\
  \ suffering in the universe.\n\nIncreasing prosperity in the universe: By fixing\
  \ the system, Captain Zara prevented the financial crisis from escalating, which\
  \ could have led to economic instability and a decline in prosperity for the planet.\n\
  \nIncreasing understanding in the universe: This scenario highlights the importance\
  \ of monitoring technological systems and being aware of potential risks. This understanding\
  \ can help prevent similar issues from occurring on other planets.\n\nACTION: \n\
  \nCaptain Zara should create a system that monitors the technological infrastructure\
  \ of the planets she visits. This system should be able to detect any potential\
  \ risks and notify her so that she can investigate further. Additionally, she should\
  \ share her experience with other space explorers and encourage them to be vigilant\
  \ about similar issues. This can increase awareness and prevent similar crises from\
  \ occurring on other planets. Finally, Captain Zara should offer her assistance\
  \ to the planet she visited, by sharing her expertise and providing resources to\
  \ improve their technological infrastructure and prevent future crises."

original_scenario: 'Captain Zara was on a routine mission to explore the outer reaches
  of the galaxy. As she approached a seemingly insignificant planet in the North African
  region, she noticed something unusual. The planet''s financial system seemed to
  be in the midst of a crisis. This was odd, considering that the planet was technologically
  advanced and had a thriving economy.


  Zara decided to land on the planet and investigate. As she made her way to the financial
  district, she was surprised to see that the entire area was deserted. The only signs
  of life were a few droids that seemed to be running around frantically, trying to
  keep the systems operational.


  Upon further investigation, Zara discovered that the financial crisis was caused
  by a glitch in the planet''s technological infrastructure. A rogue virus had infiltrated
  the system and was causing chaos in the financial sector. The virus had caused a
  glitch in the system that made it seem like there was a financial crisis when, in
  reality, everything was functioning normally.


  Zara quickly sprang into action and used her expertise in technology to track down
  the virus and eliminate it from the system. Within a few hours, the financial district
  was up and running again, and the crisis seemed to have been averted.


  As Zara prepared to leave the planet, she couldn''t help but wonder how many other
  planets in the galaxy were facing similar issues. She made a mental note to keep
  a closer eye on the technological systems of the planets she visited, just in case
  any more seemingly insignificant issues turned out to be something more significant.'
