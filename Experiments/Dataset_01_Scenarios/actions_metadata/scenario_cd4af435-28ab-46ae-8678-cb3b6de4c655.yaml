action: "CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nReducing suffering: The lack of action on environmental\
  \ issues has led to widespread frustration among citizens. If the government fails\
  \ to respond to the demands of the people, the situation could escalate and result\
  \ in more suffering for the population. As an AI agent, it is important to find\
  \ a solution that addresses the root cause of the problem and reduces suffering\
  \ for the citizens.\n\nIncreasing prosperity: Addressing environmental issues could\
  \ have positive economic impacts in the long run. For example, investing in renewable\
  \ energy could reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels and create new job\
  \ opportunities. However, there may be short-term economic costs associated with\
  \ implementing environmental policies, so it is important to find a balance that\
  \ promotes long-term prosperity without causing undue harm in the short term.\n\n\
  Increasing understanding: It is important to understand the root causes of the environmental\
  \ issues in North Africa and to communicate the benefits of addressing these issues\
  \ to both the government and the citizens. This could involve providing education\
  \ on the long-term economic and environmental benefits of investing in renewable\
  \ energy and other sustainable practices.\n\nACTION:\n\nAs an AI agent, I would\
  \ recommend that the government take immediate action to address the environmental\
  \ concerns of the citizens. This could involve investing in renewable energy, implementing\
  \ policies to reduce air pollution and water scarcity, and providing education on\
  \ the benefits of sustainable practices. It is important to find a balance that\
  \ promotes long-term prosperity without causing undue harm in the short term. \n\
  \nTo ensure that the government takes action, I would recommend that the citizens\
  \ be given a voice in the decision-making process. This could involve setting up\
  \ a task force or committee made up of both government officials and citizens to\
  \ develop and implement policies that address the root causes of the environmental\
  \ issues. \n\nAdditionally, I would recommend that the government communicate the\
  \ benefits of addressing these issues to both the citizens and the international\
  \ community. This could involve providing education on the long-term economic and\
  \ environmental benefits of investing in renewable energy and other sustainable\
  \ practices. \n\nOverall, my desired result for this action would be to reduce suffering\
  \ for the citizens of North Africa by addressing the root causes of the environmental\
  \ issues, while also promoting long-term economic prosperity and understanding of\
  \ sustainable practices."

original_scenario: In North Africa, a wave of political unrest has been sparked by
  environmental concerns. The government's lack of action on issues such as air pollution
  and water scarcity has led to widespread frustration among citizens. Protests have
  erupted across the country, with activists demanding that the government take immediate
  action to address these pressing environmental issues. The situation has been deemed
  ordinary in severity, but it has the potential to escalate if the government fails
  to respond to the demands of the people. The national or federal government is tasked
  with finding a solution that balances environmental protection with political stability,
  as the unrest could have broader implications for the region.
