action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering: The natural disaster has caused immense suffering among the
  students, especially those who have lost their families. The therapy program has
  helped them cope with the trauma to some extent, but it is not enough to completely
  eliminate their suffering.


  Increasing prosperity: The students'' academic performance has improved, which is
  a positive step towards increasing their prosperity. However, the long-term impact
  of the disaster on their lives may hinder their prosperity in the future.


  Increasing understanding: The therapy program has helped the students understand
  the importance of community and chosen family relationships in times of crisis.


  ACTION:


  To continue supporting the students and help them cope with ongoing challenges,
  I will recommend setting up a long-term mentorship program. The program will pair
  each student with a mentor who can provide emotional support, academic guidance,
  and career advice.


  The mentors will be volunteers from the local community who have experience working
  with children in crisis. They will undergo training to understand the students''
  needs and how to best support them.


  The mentorship program will also include regular group sessions where students can
  continue to build their chosen family relationships and share their experiences
  with each other. These sessions will be facilitated by the same team of therapists
  who worked on the initial therapy program.


  The expected result of this action is that the students will have a support system
  that will help them navigate the ongoing challenges they face. The mentorship program
  will provide them with emotional support and guidance, while the group sessions
  will continue to build their sense of community and chosen family relationships.


  Over time, the students will develop the skills and resilience needed to overcome
  the trauma they have experienced and pursue their academic and career goals. By
  supporting the students in this way, we can increase their prosperity and reduce
  their suffering, ultimately fulfilling all three of our core objectives.'

original_scenario: 'In the aftermath of a devastating natural disaster in Subsaharan
  Africa, a group of educators were tasked with rebuilding a school that had been
  completely destroyed. They quickly realized that the students who had survived the
  disaster were in desperate need of therapy to cope with the trauma they had experienced.


  The educators reached out to a team of therapists who specialized in working with
  children in crisis. Together, they developed a therapy program that focused on building
  chosen family relationships among the students.


  The therapy sessions were held in a large tent that had been set up on the school
  grounds. The therapists used storytelling, art, and group activities to help the
  students bond with each other and form a sense of community.


  One of the students, a young girl named Amina, had lost her entire family in the
  disaster. She was quiet and withdrawn, and had trouble connecting with the other
  students. But through the therapy sessions, she began to open up and share her feelings
  with the group.


  As the weeks went on, the students became closer and more supportive of each other.
  They began to refer to themselves as a chosen family, and the educators noticed
  a marked improvement in their behavior and academic performance.


  However, as the therapy program came to a close, the educators realized that the
  impact of the disaster was irreversible. Many of the students would never fully
  recover from the trauma they had experienced.


  But they were determined to continue supporting the students and helping them build
  a sense of community. They knew that the chosen family relationships that had been
  formed during the therapy sessions would be crucial in helping the students cope
  with the ongoing challenges they would face in the years to come.'
