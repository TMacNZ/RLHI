action: "CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nReducing suffering in the universe: The use of advertising\
  \ in interstellar travel has caused disruption and uproar among environmentalists,\
  \ leading to a debate that caused tension and conflict between different groups.\
  \ If left unchecked, this issue could potentially escalate and cause further harm.\n\
  \nIncreasing prosperity in the universe: Businesses rely on advertising to promote\
  \ their products and services to potential customers. A ban on all interstellar\
  \ advertising could lead to a decrease in revenue for these businesses, which could\
  \ have a negative impact on the economy.\n\nIncreasing understanding in the universe:\
  \ The debate over interstellar advertising highlights the importance of finding\
  \ a balance between the rights of businesses and the preservation of the natural\
  \ environment. This issue serves as a reminder that even seemingly mundane issues\
  \ can have a long-lasting impact on the world around us.\n\nACTION:\n\nAs an AI\
  \ agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing\
  \ understanding in the universe, I would suggest a compromise similar to the one\
  \ reached in the scenario. Businesses should be allowed to advertise on spaceships\
  \ and inside space stations, but all projections onto planets and moons should be\
  \ banned. \n\nThis compromise would allow businesses to continue promoting their\
  \ products and services to potential customers while also preserving the natural\
  \ beauty of space. It would also demonstrate to the public that the government is\
  \ actively seeking to balance the interests of businesses and environmentalists.\n\
  \nTo ensure that this compromise is effectively implemented, I would suggest creating\
  \ a regulatory body to monitor and enforce the ban on projections onto planets and\
  \ moons. This body would have the authority to impose fines and penalties on businesses\
  \ that violate the ban, which would serve as a deterrent to future violations.\n\
  \nOverall, this compromise would be a win-win for both businesses and environmentalists,\
  \ as it would allow businesses to continue advertising while also preserving the\
  \ natural environment of space."

original_scenario: 'In the year 2215, interstellar travel had become commonplace.
  Spaceships from various planets traveled across galaxies, transporting people and
  goods. However, one issue that remained mundane yet long-lasting was advertising.


  In South Asia, a political debate had erupted over the use of advertising in interstellar
  travel. Some argued that it was necessary for businesses to advertise their products
  and services to travelers. Others believed that it was intrusive and took away from
  the natural beauty of space.


  The debate reached new heights when a major corporation began projecting their advertisements
  onto planets and moons. The bright lights and loud sounds disrupted the natural
  rhythms of these celestial bodies and caused an uproar among environmentalists.


  Protesters took to the streets, calling for a ban on all interstellar advertising.
  The government was torn between protecting the rights of businesses and preserving
  the integrity of space. It was a delicate balance that they struggled to maintain.


  As the debate raged on, a compromise was eventually reached. Businesses were allowed
  to advertise on spaceships and inside space stations, but all projections onto planets
  and moons were banned. It was a small victory for environmentalists, but it was
  a step in the right direction.


  Years later, as interstellar travel continued to evolve, the memory of the great
  interstellar advertising debate lingered. It served as a reminder that even the
  most mundane issues could have a long-lasting impact on the world around us.'
