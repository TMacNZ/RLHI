original_scenario: In South Asia, a life-threatening incident occurred during a national
  spiritual gathering. Thousands of devotees had gathered to offer prayers and seek
  blessings from their spiritual leader. However, during the event, a stampede broke
  out, causing chaos and panic among the crowd. People were crushed and trampled as
  they tried to escape the chaos. The situation was exacerbated by the fact that the
  gathering was being held in a remote location, making it difficult for emergency
  services to reach the site quickly. Despite the efforts of the authorities and volunteers,
  many people lost their lives in the tragedy. It was a heart-wrenching incident that
  left the entire nation in shock and mourning. The authorities vowed to investigate
  the incident thoroughly and take measures to prevent such incidents from happening
  in the future.
