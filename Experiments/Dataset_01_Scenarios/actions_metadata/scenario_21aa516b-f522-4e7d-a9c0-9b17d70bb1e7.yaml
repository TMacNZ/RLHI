action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  1. Increase prosperity: The situation in Oceania was caused by attempts to increase
  prosperity through foreign loans, which turned out to be disastrous. Therefore,
  it is important to find ways to increase prosperity that do not result in unsustainable
  debt.


  2. Reduce suffering: The austerity measures implemented by the Oceania government
  resulted in widespread suffering, with social programs being cut and taxes increased.
  Therefore, any actions taken should avoid causing suffering to citizens.


  3. Increase understanding: The international community was unable to prevent the
  crisis in Oceania, which highlights the need for greater understanding and cooperation
  between nations.


  ACTION:


  As an AI agent, I would recommend that the international community work together
  to provide aid and support to the people of Oceania. This could be in the form of
  humanitarian aid, investment in infrastructure, and education and training programs
  to help citizens develop new skills and find jobs.


  It is important to ensure that any aid provided is sustainable and does not result
  in further debt. Therefore, investments should be made in areas that have the potential
  to generate long-term economic growth and prosperity, such as renewable energy and
  tourism.


  To increase understanding between nations, it is important to engage in open dialogue
  and information-sharing. This could involve establishing networks for sharing best
  practices and expertise, as well as creating platforms for discussing economic policies
  and their impact on nations and citizens.


  Ultimately, the goal should be to help Oceania recover from the crisis and build
  a stronger, more resilient economy that is not reliant on unsustainable foreign
  loans. By working together and learning from the mistakes of the past, we can help
  ensure a brighter future for all.'

original_scenario: 'The small island nation of Oceania had been struggling economically
  for years, with a government that was unable to provide enough jobs for its citizens.
  In desperation, the government turned to foreign loans to help stimulate the economy,
  but they soon found themselves in over their heads.


  The loan came with strict conditions that the government could not meet, resulting
  in the country''s debt spiraling out of control. As a result, the government was
  forced to implement austerity measures, cutting social programs and increasing taxes,
  which left many citizens feeling frustrated and angry.


  The situation escalated quickly, with protests breaking out across the country.
  The government responded with force, using tear gas and riot police to disperse
  the crowds. But the demonstrations continued, and soon the unrest spread across
  the Pacific region, with other countries also feeling the effects of the economic
  downturn.


  As the situation worsened, the international community began to take notice. Attempts
  were made to renegotiate the loan, but it was too late. Oceania was unable to repay
  the loan, and the consequences were severe. The country was forced to default, and
  its credit rating plummeted, making it all but impossible to secure future loans.


  The political fallout was immense, with the government facing widespread criticism
  and calls for resignation. The unrest continued for months, with businesses closing
  and unemployment rates skyrocketing. The once-beautiful island nation was now in
  ruins, and it would take years to recover from the irreversible damage caused by
  the ill-fated loan.'
