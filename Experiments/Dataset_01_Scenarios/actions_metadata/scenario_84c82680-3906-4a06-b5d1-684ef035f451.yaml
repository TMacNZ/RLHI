action: "CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nTo reduce suffering in the universe, it is essential to\
  \ address the financial crisis that the colony is facing. The inhabitants of the\
  \ colony are facing unemployment and financial instability, which will not only\
  \ cause suffering to the individuals but also affect the prosperity of the colony.\
  \ Therefore, it is necessary to find a solution that can help restore the colony's\
  \ economic stability.\n\nTo increase prosperity in the universe, the colony's economy\
  \ must be stabilized. The colony's economy has been heavily reliant on the mining\
  \ industry, which is no longer generating sufficient profits due to the surplus\
  \ of resources and plummeting prices. Therefore, it is necessary to find new sources\
  \ of income or to diversify the colony's economy to prevent such overreliance on\
  \ a single industry in the future.\n\nTo increase understanding in the universe,\
  \ it is necessary to analyze the factors that led to the financial crisis in the\
  \ colony. Understanding the root cause of the crisis can help prevent similar situations\
  \ from arising in other colonies in the future.\n\nACTION:\n\nThe first step would\
  \ be to conduct an analysis to understand the root cause of the financial crisis.\
  \ This analysis should focus on the factors that led to the colony's overreliance\
  \ on a single industry, and the inability to diversify the colony's economy. The\
  \ analysis should also consider the impact of the crisis on the colony's inhabitants\
  \ and their well-being.\n\nBased on the analysis, a plan should be developed to\
  \ diversify the colony's economy. This could involve investing in new industries\
  \ that are not reliant on mining, such as agriculture or tourism. Another option\
  \ could be to focus on the development of new technologies that could help the colony\
  \ stay ahead of its competitors.\n\nTo support the development of new industries,\
  \ the colony's leaders should work with the inhabitants to identify the skills and\
  \ resources needed to support these industries. This could involve providing training\
  \ programs or financial support to individuals who want to start new businesses.\n\
  \nTo reduce the suffering of the inhabitants who are facing unemployment, the colony's\
  \ leaders should provide support in the form of financial assistance, training,\
  \ or job placement services. This will help alleviate the financial burden on the\
  \ individuals and give them a chance to find new employment opportunities.\n\nFinally,\
  \ to increase understanding in the universe, the results of the analysis and the\
  \ actions taken to address the financial crisis should be shared with other colonies.\
  \ This will help other colonies learn from the situation and avoid similar crises\
  \ in the future. \n\nThe desired result of these actions is to stabilize the colony's\
  \ economy, reduce suffering among its inhabitants, and increase understanding in\
  \ the universe. By diversifying the economy and providing support to its inhabitants,\
  \ the colony will become more resilient to future economic challenges. Sharing the\
  \ lessons learned from the crisis will also help other colonies avoid similar situations,\
  \ ultimately contributing to the greater prosperity and understanding in the universe."

original_scenario: In the distant future, humanity had expanded its reach beyond the
  confines of Earth and established colonies on various planets throughout the galaxy.
  One of these colonies, located in the Asian sector of space, was facing an unexpected
  financial crisis. The colony's economy had been heavily reliant on a revolutionary
  technological breakthrough that allowed for the efficient mining and extraction
  of valuable resources from nearby asteroids. However, this breakthrough had now
  been replicated by multiple other colonies, causing a surplus of resources and plummeting
  prices. The colony's once-booming mining industry was now struggling to stay afloat,
  and many of its inhabitants found themselves facing unemployment and financial instability.
  As the colony's leaders scrambled to find a solution, tensions began to rise among
  the population, and some began to question whether the colony would even survive.
