original_scenario: 'As a successful businessman in Eurasia, Alex had always prided
  himself on his ethical business practices. He had worked hard to build his reputation
  as an honest and trustworthy entrepreneur, and it had paid off with a steady stream
  of clients and profitable deals. However, one day, he was faced with an ethical
  dilemma that would test his values and potentially have long-lasting consequences.


  Alex was in the process of negotiating a deal with a company that required a special
  permit to operate in the region. He had always followed the rules and regulations
  when it came to permits, but the company he was dealing with was pressuring him
  to use his connections to obtain the permit faster and at a lower cost. They promised
  him a significant financial reward if he could make it happen.


  At first, Alex was unsure of what to do. He knew that using his connections to obtain
  the permit would be unethical, but the financial reward was tempting. He thought
  about the potential consequences of his actions and the impact it could have on
  his reputation and business. He also considered the fact that if he didn''t go through
  with it, the company could easily find someone else who would.


  In the end, Alex decided to stick to his values and refused to help the company
  obtain the permit through illegal means. He explained that he would not compromise
  his integrity for financial gain and that he would only proceed with the deal if
  the permit was obtained legally. The company was disappointed but ultimately respected
  his decision and agreed to wait for the permit to be obtained through proper channels.


  Although Alex knew that his decision could potentially cost him the deal and financial
  reward, he was proud of himself for standing by his values. He believed that in
  the long run, his reputation and ethics would be more valuable than any financial
  gain. He also hoped that his decision would set an example for others in the business
  community to follow and promote a culture of ethical business practices.'
