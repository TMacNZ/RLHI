original_scenario: A group of tourists, mostly from Europe and North America, were
  on a guided tour of North Africa when they decided to explore a local market. As
  they were wandering through the bustling stalls, a sudden commotion caught their
  attention. A group of locals were frantically running towards them, shouting in
  Arabic. Before the tourists knew what was happening, a small explosion rocked the
  market, sending debris flying in all directions. The tourists were caught in the
  blast and suffered serious injuries. The language barrier made it difficult for
  them to communicate with the locals and seek medical assistance. The advantage of
  having a local tour guide became evident as the guide quickly sprang into action,
  providing first aid and calling for help. The severity of the situation became apparent
  as the injured tourists were rushed to the hospital, where they received life-saving
  treatment. The incident left a lasting impact on the tourists, who gained a newfound
  appreciation for the cultural differences and challenges of traveling in unfamiliar
  territories.
