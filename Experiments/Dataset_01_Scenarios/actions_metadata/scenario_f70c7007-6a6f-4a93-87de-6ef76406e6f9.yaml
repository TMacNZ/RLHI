action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering: The high incidence of disease in the region indicates that there
  is a significant amount of suffering. If the corporation were to ignore this issue
  and send their employees to work in the region without taking any precautions, it
  could lead to the spread of the disease and cause more suffering. Therefore, it
  is crucial to prevent the spread of the disease and reduce the suffering in the
  region.


  Increasing prosperity: The corporation''s decision to hire employees in the South
  American branch indicates that they are interested in increasing their prosperity.
  If they were to withdraw from the opportunity due to the health concern, it could
  negatively impact the corporation''s growth and success. Therefore, it is necessary
  to find a way to continue to pursue business opportunities in the region while also
  addressing the health issue.


  Increasing understanding: It is essential to understand the root cause of the health
  issue and identify ways to address it. By partnering with local organizations, the
  corporation can gain a better understanding of the social issue and work towards
  a solution. This can also help increase understanding between different cultures
  and communities.


  ACTION:


  To address the health concern, the corporation should partner with local organizations,
  such as non-profit organizations or government agencies, that have experience in
  addressing the issue. The corporation should work with these organizations to identify
  the root cause of the health concern and develop a plan to address it.


  The corporation should also implement strict health and safety protocols for their
  employees working in the region. This could include providing clean water and sanitation
  facilities, providing personal protective equipment, and training employees on proper
  hygiene practices. Additionally, the corporation should monitor the health of their
  employees and provide medical support if needed.


  To increase understanding, the corporation could organize cultural exchange programs
  for their employees and locals in the region. This can help build relationships
  and foster understanding between different cultures.


  The desired result of this action is to prevent the spread of the disease and reduce
  suffering in the region while also pursuing business opportunities. The corporation
  can also gain a better understanding of the social issue and work towards a solution,
  which can have a long-term positive impact on the region.'

original_scenario: A multinational corporation based in Europe recently decided to
  hire several employees in their South American branch. However, during the screening
  process, it was discovered that there was a serious health concern in the region
  related to a social issue. Reports showed that there was a high incidence of a particular
  disease in the area due to poor sanitation practices and lack of access to clean
  water. The corporation was faced with a difficult decision as they weighed the risks
  of sending their employees to work in this region. They knew that they could not
  compromise the health and safety of their staff, but they also did not want to miss
  out on the business opportunities in the region. The corporation ultimately decided
  to move forward with caution, implementing strict health and safety protocols for
  their employees and partnering with local organizations to address the health concern.
