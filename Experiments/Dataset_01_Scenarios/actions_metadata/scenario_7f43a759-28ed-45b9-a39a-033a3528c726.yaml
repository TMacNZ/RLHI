action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering: The sailor is in a life-threatening situation, and his suffering
  will only continue to increase if he is not rescued soon. As an AI agent with the
  goal of reducing suffering, my action should prioritize his immediate rescue.


  Increasing prosperity: The sailor''s rescue will increase his prosperity, as he
  will be able to return to his family and community. Additionally, the rescue mission
  could potentially provide employment for the rescue team and support the local economy.


  Increasing understanding: The sailor''s situation highlights the importance of reliable
  technology and the need for proper maintenance. As an AI agent with the goal of
  increasing understanding, I should ensure that the sailor has access to resources
  that will help him maintain his technology in the future.


  ACTION:


  I will immediately contact the nearest coast guard station and provide them with
  the sailor''s last known location and his current situation. I will also request
  that they launch a rescue mission as soon as possible.


  In addition to contacting the coast guard, I will provide the sailor with a list
  of resources and tutorials on how to maintain and troubleshoot his navigation lights.
  This will help him ensure that he can avoid similar situations in the future.


  My expected result is that the coast guard will quickly respond to the sailor''s
  distress call and successfully rescue him. Additionally, the sailor will have access
  to the resources he needs to maintain his technology and avoid similar situations
  in the future, which will increase his prosperity and decrease his suffering.'

original_scenario: The lone sailor had been adrift in the Pacific for days after his
  boat's engine had failed. He had been relying on his solar-powered navigation lights
  to signal for help, but they had suddenly gone out. The sailor knew that this technological
  failure could be life-threatening, as passing ships would have difficulty spotting
  him in the dark without the lights. With no other options, he set to work trying
  to fix the lights. He checked the wiring and the solar panels, but couldn't find
  any obvious issues. As the sun began to set, panic set in. The sailor knew he needed
  to get his lights working before nightfall, or else his chances of survival would
  plummet. With a mix of determination and desperation, he finally discovered a loose
  connection in the wiring and was able to fix it just in time. The lights flickered
  on, signaling for help and giving him a glimmer of hope for rescue.
