original_scenario: In North Africa, a serious incident occurred that had a significant
  economic impact. A large cloud of dust and sand swept through the region, causing
  damage to local businesses and disrupting crucial supply chains. The severity of
  the incident was compounded by the fact that many of these businesses were already
  struggling due to the ongoing economic challenges in the region. As a result, the
  cloud had a devastating impact on the livelihoods of many people in the area, who
  were left to pick up the pieces and try to rebuild their businesses in the aftermath
  of the incident. Despite the challenges they faced, however, many of these entrepreneurs
  were determined to persevere and find a way to overcome the obstacles in their path.
  Through resilience and determination, they were able to rebuild their businesses
  and reestablish the critical economic connections that had been disrupted by the
  cloud.
