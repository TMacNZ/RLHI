action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering: The disagreement between the family members could lead to tensions
  and disputes, which could cause emotional distress and suffering. It is essential
  to find a solution that will not cause any harm to any individual.


  Increasing prosperity: Economic development is necessary for prosperity, but not
  at the cost of destroying the environment. It is essential to find a solution that
  promotes sustainable economic growth while protecting the forest''s biodiversity.


  Increasing understanding: It is necessary to promote understanding and awareness
  of the importance of preserving the rainforest''s ecosystem. It is crucial to educate
  the family members on the long-term benefits of preserving the environment.


  ACTION:


  The first step is to organize a family meeting to discuss the issue and understand
  each other''s perspectives. Maria can explain the importance of preserving the rainforest
  and its impact on the environment, economy, and society. She can also provide examples
  of other communities that have successfully implemented sustainable practices and
  achieved economic growth.


  Next, the family can discuss potential solutions that promote economic development
  while protecting the environment. For example, they can explore eco-tourism opportunities,
  sustainable farming practices, and responsible mining and logging practices. They
  can also discuss the long-term benefits of preserving the forest, such as increased
  carbon sequestration, which can help mitigate climate change.


  To increase understanding, Maria can organize educational workshops on environmental
  conservation and sustainable development. She can invite experts to speak about
  the benefits of preserving the forest and the negative consequences of deforestation.
  She can also organize field trips to nearby conservation areas to showcase the beauty
  and importance of preserving the ecosystem.


  The desired result is to find a solution that promotes sustainable economic growth
  while preserving the environment. By promoting understanding and awareness, the
  family can work together to find a solution that benefits everyone and protects
  the Amazon rainforest''s biodiversity.'

original_scenario: The extended family of Maria, who lived in a remote village in
  the Amazon rainforest of South America, had been in a long-lasting disagreement
  over environmental issues. Maria recognized the importance of preserving the forest
  and its biodiversity, while her relatives, who had recently migrated to the region,
  saw it as an opportunity for economic development. The argument had intensified
  over the years, with Maria's family accusing her of being ignorant of the benefits
  of logging, mining, and farming. Meanwhile, Maria felt frustrated by their lack
  of appreciation for the beauty and fragility of the ecosystem. Despite attempts
  to reconcile, the tension persisted, and the family's unity was at risk. Maria knew
  that finding a solution to this environmental dispute was crucial not only for her
  family but also for the future of the rainforest.
