  \ of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding, my\
  \ immediate action would be to offer emotional support and resources to those affected\
  \ by the incident. This can be done by:\n\n1. Contacting the human resources department\
  \ of the office to offer counseling services to employees who witnessed the incident\
  \ and are struggling to cope with the emotional trauma.\n\n2. Providing information\
  \ on the importance of workplace safety and the need for proper training and equipment\
  \ for workers performing dangerous tasks. This can be done through email communication\

  \ to support each other during this difficult time by facilitating group discussions\
  \ or team-building activities that promote team bonding and emotional support.\n\
