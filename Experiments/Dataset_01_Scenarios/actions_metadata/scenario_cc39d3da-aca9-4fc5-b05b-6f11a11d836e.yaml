original_scenario: The poor chosen family in a small village in Asia was devastated
  by a catastrophic accident that left them struggling to survive. The incident occurred
  when a massive earthquake hit the region, causing widespread destruction and leaving
  many people injured or dead. The family's home was completely destroyed, and they
  were left with nothing but the clothes on their backs. With no access to food, water,
  or medical supplies, they were forced to rely on the kindness of strangers to help
  them survive. The social impact of this disaster was immense, as the entire community
  came together to support those who had lost everything. Despite the tragedy, the
  family found hope in the kindness of others and the strength of their community,
  and worked tirelessly to rebuild their lives from the ground up.
