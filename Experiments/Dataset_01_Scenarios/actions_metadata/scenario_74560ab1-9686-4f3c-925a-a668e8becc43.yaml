action: "CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nReducing suffering in the universe: Lena's main goal is\
  \ to reduce the suffering of her friends who are affected by the financial crisis.\
  \ She understands the importance of having a support system and wants to strengthen\
  \ the bond between her and her friends.\n\nIncreasing prosperity in the universe:\
  \ Lena's action of getting matching tattoos with her friends may not directly contribute\
  \ to increasing prosperity in the universe. However, it could help her friends feel\
  \ more secure and optimistic about their situation, which could lead to better decision-making\
  \ and financial planning.\n\nIncreasing understanding in the universe: Lena's action\
  \ may not contribute directly to increasing understanding in the universe. However,\
  \ it could promote the idea of chosen families and the importance of having meaningful\
  \ connections with others.\n\nACTION:\n\nLena's action of getting matching tattoos\
  \ with her friends is a positive and meaningful way to strengthen the bond between\
  \ them. It is important for Lena to remind her friends that they are not alone and\
  \ that they can rely on each other during tough times. \n\nThe palm tree tattoo\
  \ was a fitting choice, as it symbolizes growth, resilience, and stability. Lena\
  \ should encourage her friends to focus on these qualities as they navigate the\
  \ financial crisis together. \n\nAdditionally, Lena should continue to support her\
  \ friends by offering emotional support, helping them with job searches, and exploring\
  \ other ways to cut costs. By working together and supporting each other, Lena and\
  \ her friends can overcome the challenges they face and emerge stronger than ever\
  \ before."

original_scenario: "Lena had always been a bit of an outsider in her family. She never\
  \ quite fit in with her parents or her sister, but she found her chosen family in\
  \ her group of friends. They had all met while backpacking in the South Pacific,\
  \ and they had stuck together ever since. \n\nOne day, Lena received a frantic phone\
  \ call from her friend Sarah. \"Lena, have you heard about the financial crisis?\
  \ It's hitting us hard. We might have to cut our trip short.\"\n\nLena was stunned.\
  \ She had been so caught up in the beauty of the South Pacific that she hadn't even\
  \ considered the possibility of a financial crisis. She immediately called a group\
  \ meeting, and they all sat down to discuss their options.\n\n\"We could try to\
  \ get jobs here,\" suggested Jake. \"But I don't know if we would make enough to\
  \ sustain ourselves.\"\n\n\"We could cut back on expenses,\" said Sarah. \"But we're\
  \ already living pretty frugally.\"\n\nLena listened to their suggestions, but she\
  \ couldn't shake the feeling that they needed to do something more drastic. That's\
  \ when she got an idea.\n\n\"What if we all got matching tattoos?\" she suggested.\
  \ \"Something that would signify our chosen family and remind us that we're in this\
  \ together.\"\n\nThe group was hesitant at first, but Lena's enthusiasm soon won\
  \ them over. They found a local tattoo artist and each got a small impression of\
  \ a palm tree on their wrist.\n\nAs they left the tattoo parlor, Lena felt a sense\
  \ of belonging that she had never experienced before. She knew that no matter what\
  \ challenges they faced, they would always have each other. And in that moment,\
  \ the financial crisis seemed insignificant compared to the strength of their chosen\
  \ family."
