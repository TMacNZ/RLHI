action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Objective 1: Reduce suffering in the universe

  The suffering caused by the cosmic album''s harmful waves is a pressing concern
  that must be addressed immediately. The symptoms being experienced by the villagers
  are severe and can even lead to death if not treated on time. Therefore, it is crucial
  to find a way to neutralize the album''s waves to minimize the suffering of the
  affected individuals.


  Objective 2: Increase prosperity in the universe

  The danger posed by the cosmic album is not only a threat to the physical health
  of the affected individuals but also to the economic prosperity of the continent.
  If the album''s effects are not contained and neutralized, it could lead to a widespread
  epidemic, which could have a significant economic impact on the continent. Therefore,
  it is essential to take swift action to prevent such an outcome.


  Objective 3: Increase understanding in the universe

  The discovery of the cosmic album is a unique opportunity to increase our understanding
  of the universe. Studying the album''s composition and the effects of its waves
  can provide valuable insights into the workings of the cosmos. Therefore, it is
  vital to study the album while also ensuring the safety of the affected individuals.


  ACTION:


  The first step towards addressing this crisis would be to set up a task force of
  experts in various fields, including physics, medicine, and engineering. This team
  would be responsible for developing a plan to neutralize the harmful waves emitted
  by the cosmic album.


  The next step would be to develop a device capable of neutralizing the waves emitted
  by the album. The device would need to be portable and easy to deploy in the affected
  areas. The task force would work with engineers to design and build such a device.


  Once the device is ready, it would be deployed in the quarantine zone, and its effectiveness
  would be tested. If successful, the device would be mass-produced and deployed across
  the continent to neutralize the harmful waves emitted by the album.


  During this process, it would also be crucial to provide medical assistance to the
  affected individuals. A team of medical professionals would be deployed to the quarantine
  zone to treat the affected individuals and monitor their progress.


  Finally, the task force would work on studying the album''s composition and the
  effects of its waves to gain a better understanding of the cosmos. This would involve
  collecting data and samples from the album and analyzing them in a laboratory setting.


  The desired result of these actions would be to neutralize the harmful waves emitted
  by the cosmic album, treat the affected individuals, and prevent further spread
  of the album''s effects. Additionally, the knowledge gained from studying the album
  would contribute to our understanding of the universe, furthering our objective
  of increasing understanding in the universe.'

original_scenario: In a remote village in Europe, a group of scientists discovered
  a dangerous cosmic album that had crash-landed on Earth. This album emitted powerful
  waves that disrupted the physical health of anyone within a hundred-mile radius.
  The villagers, unaware of the danger, began to experience strange symptoms ranging
  from headaches and nausea to more severe conditions like seizures and respiratory
  distress. The scientists immediately set up a quarantine zone to prevent further
  spread of the album's effects, but they knew they needed to act fast to find a way
  to neutralize the album's harmful waves before the entire continent was affected.
  As they worked tirelessly in their lab, the rest of Europe watched in fear, hoping
  for a solution before it was too late.
