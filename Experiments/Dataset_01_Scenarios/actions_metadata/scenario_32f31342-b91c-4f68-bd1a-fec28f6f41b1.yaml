original_scenario: In the midst of an intergalactic dispute, tensions rise between
  two Middle Eastern factions, resulting in a violent clash that leaves numerous individuals
  sick and injured. The conflict quickly spirals out of control as both sides refuse
  to back down, leading to a prolonged legal battle over who is responsible for the
  damages and who should be held accountable for the sick and injured. As the legal
