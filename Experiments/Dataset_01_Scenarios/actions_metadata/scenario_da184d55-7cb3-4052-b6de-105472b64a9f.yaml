action: "CONSIDERATIONS:\n \nObjective 1: Reduce suffering in the universe\nThe situation\
  \ described does not seem to involve any significant suffering, so it is not necessary\
  \ to focus on this objective.\n\nObjective 2: Increase prosperity in the universe\n\
  This scenario presents an opportunity to increase prosperity in the universe as\
  \ the group's visit to the European village will contribute to the local economy.\
  \ The unexpected rest due to John's phone dying could also lead to the group spending\
  \ more time and money in the village, supporting local businesses.\n\nObjective\
  \ 3: Increase understanding in the universe\nThis scenario also presents an opportunity\
  \ to increase understanding in the universe. With their digital map unavailable,\
  \ the group must rely on their instincts to guide them through the village. This\
  \ could lead to a deeper understanding of the local culture, traditions, and way\
  \ of life.\n\nACTION:\n\nGiven the opportunity to increase prosperity and understanding,\
  \ the best course of action is to continue with the group's original plan of exploring\
  \ the village and supporting local businesses. It may be useful to take note of\
  \ the electronic repair shop's location in case of any future technological difficulties,\
  \ but the focus should remain on immersing oneself in the local culture and experiencing\
  \ the village through a more organic lens. By doing so, the group can contribute\
  \ to the prosperity of the village and gain a deeper understanding of the local\

original_scenario: It was a beautiful summer day and John, together with his chosen
  family, decided to take a trip to a quaint European village. They were all looking
  forward to it and were excited to explore the charming streets and indulge in the
  local cuisine. However, their plans were disrupted when John's phone suddenly died,
  leaving them without access to their digital map and other important information.
  They tried to revive it, but to no avail. Despite the minor setback, they decided
  to continue with their adventure and rely on their instincts to guide them. As they
  wandered through the winding streets, they stumbled upon a small electronic repair
  shop. The technician was able to quickly fix John's phone and the group was able
  to continue with their plans, feeling grateful for the unexpected rest that allowed
  them to appreciate the simple pleasures of the village.
