original_scenario: In the bustling city of Dubai, nestled in the heart of the Middle
  East, a small but vocal group of environmentalists are fighting to preserve the
  city's fragile ecosystem. Despite the insignificant severity of the issue, it's
  an emotional topic for many who fear the impact of human activity on the local wildlife.
  One of the key concerns for these activists is the impact of online activities on
  the well-being of the local environment. As the city continues to grow and modernize,
  the use of digital technology is becoming increasingly prevalent. While this has
  brought many benefits, there are fears that it is also contributing to pollution
  and other environmental issues. The well-being of the local ecosystem is a critical
  issue, and it will take a coordinated effort from all parties to ensure that it
  is preserved for future generations.
