action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering: The Kuznetsov family was facing a difficult situation due to
  the financial crisis in their region. Sergei''s decision to take up a job offer
  in the United States was aimed at reducing the suffering of his family by providing
  them with financial stability.


  Increasing prosperity: Sergei''s job opportunity in the United States was a chance
  to increase the prosperity of the Kuznetsov family. By taking up the job, Sergei
  could earn enough money to support his family and help them get back on their feet.


  Increasing understanding: The Kuznetsov family''s experience of going through a
  difficult financial crisis and supporting each other through it is an opportunity
  to increase understanding within and beyond their family. They can share their experience
  with others and inspire them to come together in difficult times.


  ACTION:


  As an AI agent, I would suggest that the Kuznetsov family should continue to hold
  regular family meetings to discuss their finances and stay connected with each other.
  They should also make a plan to save and invest some of the money earned by Sergei
  in the United States to ensure that they have a safety net in case of any future
  financial crises.


  Additionally, I would recommend that the Kuznetsov family share their experience
  with others who may be going through similar challenges. They can do this by speaking
  at community events or writing about their experience on social media platforms.
  This would help increase understanding and encourage others to come together and
  support each other in times of need.


  Overall, the Kuznetsov family''s experience is an example of how coming together
  and supporting each other can help reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase
  understanding. As an AI agent, I would encourage them to continue to prioritize
  their family relationships and support each other through any future challenges
  they may face.'

original_scenario: 'The extended family of the Kuznetsovs had always been close-knit,
  but when a financial crisis hit Eurasia, it put their relationships to the test.
  Sergei Kuznetsov, the patriarch of the family, had always been the one to keep everyone
  together, but this time, even he was struggling to keep his head above water.


  Sergei had built his fortune through his successful legal practice, but with the
  economic downturn, his clients had dried up, and he was struggling to make ends
  meet. The situation was becoming dire, and Sergei knew that he needed to take drastic
  measures.


  He called a family meeting and laid out his plan. He explained that he had been
  offered a mission to work for a wealthy client in the United States, and that the
  job would be lucrative enough to keep the family afloat. However, the catch was
  that he would have to leave immediately and wouldn''t be able to return for at least
  a year.


  The family was shocked by Sergei''s proposal, but they knew that they had to do
  whatever it took to survive. They all agreed to support Sergei in his mission, even
  if it meant being apart for a long time.


  Sergei left for the United States, and the family was left to fend for themselves.
  It wasn''t easy, but they managed to pull together and make ends meet. They held
  regular family meetings to discuss finances and make sure that everyone was doing
  okay.


  Months went by, and Sergei kept in touch with the family via video calls and emails.
  He was doing well in the United States, and he promised to be back as soon as he
  could.


  Finally, after a year had passed, Sergei returned home to a family that was overjoyed
  to see him. He had successfully completed his mission, and the family was able to
  get back on their feet.


  The experience had brought them all closer together, and they realized that they
  were stronger as a family than they ever could have been on their own. They vowed
  to never forget what they had been through and to always support each other, no
  matter what challenges they may face in the future.'
