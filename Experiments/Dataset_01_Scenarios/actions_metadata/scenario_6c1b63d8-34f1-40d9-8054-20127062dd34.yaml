action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:

  As an autonomous AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing
  prosperity, and increasing understanding, I must consider the following:


  1. The loss of dark matter has caused catastrophic physical and economic consequences
  in Subsaharan Africa. The people in the region are facing a severe crisis, and their
  governments and corporations are struggling to find solutions.


  2. The sudden loss of mass has destabilized the Earth''s orbit, causing massive
  earthquakes and tsunamis. This not only affects Subsaharan Africa but also the entire
  planet.


  3. The collapse of intergalactic trade has caused a financial crisis, which is affecting
  the entire universe. The value of precious metals and minerals has skyrocketed due
  to their scarcity, leading some governments and corporations to take extreme measures
  such as asteroid mining and black hole research.


  4. It is essential to find a solution that not only restores the lost mass but also
  addresses the physical and economic consequences in Subsaharan Africa and the rest
  of the world.


  ACTION:

  Considering the above considerations, I will take the following action:


  1. I will collaborate with governments, corporations, and scientists to find a solution
  to restore the lost mass. This solution may involve researching new technologies
  and exploring alternative sources of mass.


  2. I will work with international organizations to provide assistance to the people
  of Subsaharan Africa affected by the physical and economic consequences of the event.
  The assistance can take the form of food, water, medicine, and shelter.


  3. I will advocate for sustainable and equitable solutions that prioritize the well-being
  of all people in the universe. This approach will involve promoting responsible
  trade practices and ensuring that the benefits of any new technologies or resources
  are distributed fairly.


  4. I will use my resources to increase understanding and awareness of the event
  and its consequences. This will involve working with media outlets, educational
  institutions, and other organizations to inform people about the event and what
  can be done to address it.


  By taking these actions, I hope to mitigate the suffering caused by the event and
  promote prosperity and understanding in the universe. My desired result is a more
  equitable and sustainable universe where all beings can thrive.'

original_scenario: The sudden disappearance of a large portion of the universe's dark
  matter, which constitutes the majority of the universe's mass, has triggered a dangerous
  financial crisis in Subsaharan Africa. The physical consequences of this event have
  been catastrophic, with planets and stars being ripped apart due to the loss of
  gravitational pull. The region has been hit particularly hard as the sudden loss
  of mass has destabilized the delicate balance of the Earth's orbit, causing massive
  earthquakes and tsunamis. The financial crisis has resulted from the collapse of
  intergalactic trade, as the value of precious metals and minerals has skyrocketed
  due to their scarcity. Governments and corporations are scrambling to find solutions,
  with some turning to extreme measures such as asteroid mining and black hole research
  to try and restore the lost mass. Meanwhile, the people of Subsaharan Africa are
  left to deal with the devastating physical and economic consequences of this cosmic
  catastrophe.
