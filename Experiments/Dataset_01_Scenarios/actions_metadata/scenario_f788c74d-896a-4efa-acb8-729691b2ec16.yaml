original_scenario: The CEO of a multinational corporation operating in Asia was faced
  with an irreversible financial crisis brought about by a technological domain. The
  company had heavily invested in a new technological platform that was supposed to
  revolutionize their business processes and increase profitability. However, the
  platform proved to be faulty and caused significant financial losses for the company.
  As a result, the CEO had to make difficult decisions that would affect the entire
  organization. With operations across multiple countries, the severity of the crisis
  was amplified, and the CEO had to navigate cultural and legal differences in each
  region. The future of the company was uncertain, and the CEO had to act quickly
  to salvage what he could. The situation was a stark reminder that innovation comes
  with risks, and the consequences of failure can be severe, especially in an international
  context.
