original_scenario: In the heart of downtown Paris, a massive earthquake struck the
  city, leaving destruction and chaos in its wake. Buildings crumbled to the ground,
  roads were split open, and people were trapped under the rubble. Amidst the chaos,
  a young couple, Julien and Amelie, were separated from each other. Julien was on
  his way to meet Amelie for their anniversary dinner when the earthquake hit, and
  he was trapped under a pile of debris. Amelie, who was waiting anxiously at the
  restaurant, had no idea what had happened to Julien. As days turned to weeks, and
  weeks turned to months, Amelie continued to search for Julien, never giving up hope
  that he was still alive. She was determined to find him, and her relentless search
  took her through the devastated city, where she encountered other survivors who
  were also struggling to cope with the aftermath of the disaster. Through it all,
  Amelie's love for Julien kept her going, and she never gave up hope that they would
  be reunited once again. Eventually, after months of searching, Amelie finally found
  Julien, who had miraculously survived his ordeal. The two were overjoyed to be reunited,
  and they knew that their love had helped them to weather the storm. Despite the
  devastation that had befallen their city, Julien and Amelie knew that they would
  always have each other, and that their love would endure even in the face of the
  most severe challenges.
