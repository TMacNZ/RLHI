  ACTION:


  As an AI agent, my immediate response to this scenario would be to alert the local
  authorities and emergency services to provide medical assistance to the injured
  skiers. It is essential to prioritize their physical well-being to reduce their
  suffering.


  In addition to medical attention, emotional support is also necessary. The spiritual
  guru''s calming presence and teachings have helped the skiers cope with the situation.
  Thus, we can provide counseling services to the skiers, including the teaching of
  emotional regulation, to help them process their trauma.


  Finally, we can also take this opportunity to increase understanding in the universe
  by promoting the power of spirituality. We can create a platform where individuals
  who have experienced traumatic events can share their stories and how spirituality
  helped them cope with the situation. By sharing these stories, we can inspire people
  to seek spiritual guidance in times of crisis.


  Overall, our action should prioritize the physical and emotional needs of the skiers
  while also promoting the power of spirituality in helping people cope with traumatic
  events.'

original_scenario: 'In the mountains of South Asia, a group of international skiers
  had gathered for a spiritual retreat. They had come from different parts of the
  world, seeking solace in the serene surroundings and the teachings of their spiritual
  guru. As part of their retreat, they had planned a skiing expedition on the nearby
  slopes.


  But as they were skiing down the mountain, a critical technological failure occurred.
  The ski lift that was carrying some of the skiers up the mountain suddenly malfunctioned,
  and the cable snapped, causing the lift to plummet to the ground. The skiers on
  board were thrown off the lift and landed on the slope with a thud.


  The severity of the situation was immediately apparent. Some of the skiers had suffered
  critical injuries, while others were trapped under the debris of the lift. Panic
  set in as the skiers tried to assess the situation and provide help to those who
  were injured.


  As the skiers struggled to cope with the situation, their spiritual guru arrived
  at the scene. She had been skiing on another slope when she heard about the accident.
  She immediately took charge of the situation and began to offer spiritual guidance
  to the injured and the traumatized.


  Despite the chaos and confusion, the guru''s calming presence brought a sense of
  peace to the skiers. She led them in a prayer, asking for the well-being of those
  who were injured and the strength to cope with the situation.


  The accident had shaken the skiers to their core, but the guru''s teachings gave
  them the strength to endure. They continued their spiritual retreat, with a newfound
  appreciation for the fragility of life and the power of spirituality in times of
  crisis.'
