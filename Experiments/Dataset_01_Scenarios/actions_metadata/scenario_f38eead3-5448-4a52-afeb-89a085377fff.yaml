original_scenario: It was the night of her high school graduation party and Mary was
  excited to celebrate with her friends. The music was blasting and the drinks were
  flowing as Mary danced the night away. However, things took a dangerous turn when
  Mary suddenly collapsed on the dance floor, clutching her chest in pain. Her friends
  frantically called for help as Mary struggled to breathe. It wasn't until later
  that they discovered the cause of her sudden collapse - Mary had a pre-existing
  heart condition that had been exacerbated by the excessive alcohol consumption and
  high-energy dancing. This health concern is not uncommon in Subsaharan Africa, where
  access to proper healthcare and education is limited. Mary's scary experience served
  as a reminder for her and her peers to prioritize their health and make informed
  decisions when it comes to partying.
