original_scenario: 'The bustling city of Mumbai was hit by a devastating natural disaster
  - a powerful cyclone that took everyone by surprise. As the storm raged on, the
  local authorities issued a red alert and urged people to stay indoors. However,
  for the guests of the luxurious Grand Hotel, it was too late.


  The hotel, located near the coast, was hit hard by the cyclone. The strong winds
  and heavy rains caused extensive damage to the building, and the guests were trapped
  inside. With no power and limited communication, they were cut off from the outside
  world.


  The situation was dire, and the hotel staff knew they had to act fast. They quickly
  mobilized and began to assess the damage. The structural engineers declared that
  the building was unstable, and it was not safe for the guests to stay inside. The
  staff had to evacuate the guests immediately.


  The hotel had a sophisticated online booking system that was crucial in this situation.
  The staff used the system to identify the guests who were staying at the hotel and
  contacted their families to inform them about the situation. They also used the
  system to book rooms for the guests in nearby hotels that were not affected by the
  cyclone.


  The staff worked tirelessly to ensure the safety and comfort of the guests, and
  soon they were all evacuated to the nearby hotels. The Grand Hotel suffered significant
  economic losses, but the safety of their guests was their top priority.


  The natural disaster had a profound impact on the region, and it took months for
  the city to recover fully. However, the quick thinking and efficient response of
  the Grand Hotel staff saved the lives of many guests, and their online booking system
  played a crucial role in the evacuation process. The incident highlighted the importance
  of disaster preparedness for businesses, especially those in high-risk areas.'
