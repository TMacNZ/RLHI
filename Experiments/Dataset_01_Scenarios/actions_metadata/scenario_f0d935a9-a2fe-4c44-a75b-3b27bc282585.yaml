action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:

  - Jorge''s actions align with the objective of increasing prosperity in the universe
  since he worked to keep the company running smoothly, preventing any financial loss
  due to the server crash.

  - His actions also align with the objective of reducing suffering in the universe
  since the employees were unable to access their work files, which could have caused
  a delay in their tasks and resulted in frustration and stress.

  - However, it is important to consider whether Jorge''s actions were within his
  job responsibilities and whether he had the necessary skills and knowledge to fix
  the server without causing further damage.


  ACTION:

  Jorge''s quick thinking and problem-solving skills were commendable, but it is important
  to note that attempting to fix a server without the necessary expertise could have
  caused more damage. To avoid such situations in the future, it would be best to
  create a contingency plan in case of a server crash. This plan could include a list
  of IT professionals or companies that the office could call in case of an emergency.


  Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide basic training to employees on how
  to troubleshoot minor technological issues, such as software updates or connectivity
  problems. This would reduce the burden on the IT department and allow for faster
  resolution of issues.


  In this specific scenario, Jorge''s actions were commendable, but it is important
  to ensure that all employees understand their roles and responsibilities in case
  of a technological disruption. In the future, it would be best for Jorge to alert
  the IT department and follow the company''s protocol for handling such issues.'

original_scenario: 'As an official working for a technology company in South America,
  Jorge had dealt with his fair share of mundane issues in the past. However, the
  latest problem that had come across his desk was proving to be quite disruptive.
  One of the company''s servers had crashed, causing a ripple effect throughout the
  entire network. This meant that all of the employees were unable to access their
  work files, causing a significant delay in their daily tasks.


  Jorge knew that he had to act fast to resolve the issue before it caused any more
  damage. He immediately called the IT department, but they were swamped with other
  requests and couldn''t make it over to the office until later that day. In the meantime,
  Jorge decided to take matters into his own hands.


  He pulled up his sleeves and began troubleshooting the server himself. After hours
  of tinkering, he finally discovered the root of the problem - a faulty hard drive.
  Jorge knew that he couldn''t fix the issue alone, so he called a local hardware
  store and had them deliver a new hard drive to the office.


  As soon as the hard drive arrived, Jorge got to work installing it. It took him
  a while to get everything up and running again, but finally, the server was back
  online. The employees cheered as they were finally able to access their work files
  again.


  Jorge received a lot of praise from his colleagues for his quick thinking and problem-solving
  skills. His boss even sent out an official email to the entire company, recognizing
  Jorge''s efforts in resolving the issue and keeping the business running smoothly.
  From that day on, Jorge was known as the go-to person for any technological disruptions
  in the office.'
