action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering in the universe:


  The current situation in the Middle East region is causing suffering among its population
  due to the lack of job opportunities. The increase in crime rates and social unrest
  also adds to the suffering of the people. Therefore, it is essential to address
  this issue.


  Increasing prosperity in the universe:


  By creating new job opportunities and stabilizing the economy of the Middle East
  region, the intergalactic community can increase prosperity not only in that particular
  region but also in the entire universe. It will help in maintaining peace and stability
  in the region and the intergalactic community.


  Increasing understanding in the universe:


  To solve this crisis, the intergalactic community needs to understand the root causes
  of the problem, and it requires working with the local government and businesses.
  It will help in developing a comprehensive plan that can address the issue effectively.
  It is also an opportunity to learn about the culture and society of the Middle East
  region.


  ACTION:


  I recommend working with the local government and businesses to develop a comprehensive
  plan that creates new job opportunities. The plan should focus on the following:


  1. Identifying the industries that have the potential to grow and create new jobs,
  such as renewable energy, technology, and infrastructure development.


  2. Providing training and education to the population to equip them with the necessary
  skills to work in these industries.


  3. Encouraging entrepreneurship by providing financial support and resources to
  start businesses.


  4. Providing incentives to businesses to invest in the region and create new job
  opportunities.


  5. Ensuring that the plan is sustainable and can continue to create new job opportunities
  in the long run.


  To carry out this plan, I recommend sending a team of experts with diverse backgrounds,
  including economists, business leaders, and local experts, to work with the local
  government and businesses. The team should be culturally sensitive and respectful
  of the local customs and traditions. The team should also work closely with the
  local community to ensure that they are involved in the process and have a say in
  the decisions that affect them.


  The expected result of this plan is the creation of new job opportunities that will
  stabilize the economy of the Middle East region, reduce crime rates, and social
  unrest. It will also demonstrate the intergalactic community''s commitment to reducing
  suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe.'

original_scenario: In the year 2148, the intergalactic community was facing a dangerous
  social challenge in the Middle East region. With the rise of adult unemployment
  rates, the economic stability of the region was at risk. The intergalactic government
  had tried to implement various policies to combat the issue, but to no avail. The
  situation had escalated to the point where the population was on the brink of a
  mass uprising. The lack of job opportunities had led to an increase in crime rates
  and social unrest. The intergalactic community knew that they had to act fast before
  the situation spiraled out of control. In a desperate attempt to alleviate the crisis,
  they sent in a team of experts to work with the local government and businesses
  to develop a comprehensive plan to create new job opportunities. The success of
  this mission would be critical not only for the Middle East but for the entire intergalactic
  community.
