original_scenario: 'Rahul had always been a meticulous person, especially when it
  came to his finances. He kept a detailed record of his expenses and savings in his
  personal account, which he checked every day. However, one day, he received an alarming
  notification from his bank, stating that his account had been compromised.


  Rahul was stunned. He had never shared his account details with anyone, and he had
  always been careful with his online transactions. He immediately contacted the bank,
  and they informed him that his account had been hacked by someone in South Asia,
  who had been making unauthorized transactions for weeks.


  The news came as a shock to Rahul. He had never been to South Asia, and he couldn''t
  understand how someone had gained access to his account. The bank assured him that
  they would investigate the matter, but it would take time to resolve.


  Days turned into weeks, and Rahul found himself constantly worried about his finances.
  He had to put a hold on all his transactions and was unable to access his own account.
  He was in a state of panic, wondering how long this would last and if he would ever
  get his money back.


  As the investigation continued, it was discovered that the hacker had gained access
  to Rahul''s account through a phishing email that Rahul had unknowingly responded
  to. The hacker had used this opportunity to steal Rahul''s account details and started
  making transactions in South Asia.


  The incident had a long-lasting impact on Rahul. He had to go through a lengthy
  process to recover his account and get his money back. He felt violated and vulnerable,
  not to mention the financial burden he had to bear due to the unauthorized transactions.


  From that day on, Rahul became extra cautious with his online activities. He had
  learned the hard way that one small mistake could have severe consequences. He made
  sure to educate himself on online security and never let his guard down again.'
