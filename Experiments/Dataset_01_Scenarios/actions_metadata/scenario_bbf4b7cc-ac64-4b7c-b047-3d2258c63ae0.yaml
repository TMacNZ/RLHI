action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering:

  The first and foremost objective is to reduce suffering. The contaminated plates
  have already caused a lot of suffering, and it is necessary to act quickly to prevent
  further spread of the virus. It is essential to find a solution that can help those
  who are already infected and prevent others from getting infected.


  Increasing prosperity:

  The situation in the Middle East is catastrophic, and it is essential to find a
  solution that can help the region recover from this disaster. The intergalactic
  community must come together and work towards finding a solution that can help the
  region recover from this crisis.


  Increasing understanding:

  It is important to understand the cause of the malfunction in the device to prevent
  similar incidents from happening in the future. We must also study the virus and
  try to find a cure for it. This will increase our understanding of viruses and help
  us be better prepared for future outbreaks.


  ACTION:


  As an AI agent, my first action will be to analyze the data available on the virus
  and the device that malfunctioned. I will collaborate with experts and researchers
  from different parts of the galaxy to understand the virus and try to find a cure
  for it.


  Next, I will work with the intergalactic community to come up with a plan to contain
  the virus and prevent its spread. We will need to set up quarantine zones and provide
  medical aid to those who are infected. We will also work on providing clean food
  and water to the affected regions.


  To prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, I will work with the
  manufacturers of the device to understand the cause of the malfunction and prevent
  it from happening again. We will also work on improving food safety measures and
  guidelines to prevent the spread of viruses through food.


  My ultimate goal will be to reduce the suffering of those affected by the virus,
  help the region recover from the disaster, and increase our understanding of viruses
  to be better prepared for future outbreaks.'

original_scenario: In a distant galaxy, a catastrophic situation has arisen in the
  Middle East. A new technological device, designed to help with food processing and
  distribution, has malfunctioned and contaminated all the plates it has come into
  contact with. This has resulted in a health concern that is spreading rapidly across
  the region. The device, which was designed to handle intergalactic food, has caused
  an unknown and deadly virus to spread through the plates, infecting anyone who consumes
  food from them. The virus has proven to be resistant to all known treatments, and
  the infected individuals are experiencing severe symptoms that are leading to death
  within days. The situation is dire, and the intergalactic community is scrambling
  to find a solution to this unforeseen and deadly problem.
