action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:

  Lillian''s story highlights the difficulties that many students from disadvantaged
  backgrounds face when pursuing higher education. As an AI agent with the objective
  of increasing prosperity and reducing suffering, it is important to consider how
  we can support students like Lillian to succeed in their academic pursuits.


  One key consideration is the financial aspect of higher education. Scholarships
  can provide a valuable opportunity for students to access higher education, but
  they may not cover all the costs associated with attending university. This can
  put additional pressure on students and impact their ability to succeed academically.
  Therefore, it is important to explore ways to provide financial support and reduce
  the financial burden on students from disadvantaged backgrounds.


  Another consideration is the social and emotional support that students need to
  succeed in university. Many students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds,
  may struggle to adjust to the academic and social demands of university life. They
  may feel isolated and overwhelmed, which can impact their mental health and academic
  performance. It is important to provide students with access to supportive networks,
  such as peer mentoring or counseling services, to help them navigate these challenges.


  ACTION:

  To support students like Lillian, I would propose the following action:


  1. Establish a scholarship program that covers all the costs associated with attending
  university, including tuition fees, textbooks, accommodation, and living expenses.
  This will help to reduce the financial burden on students and allow them to focus
  on their studies.


  2. Provide students with access to peer mentoring and counseling services to support
  their social and emotional well-being. This will help to create a supportive and
  inclusive learning environment that encourages students to thrive.


  3. Partner with local organizations and community leaders to provide students with
  opportunities to apply their academic knowledge and skills to real-world challenges.
  This will help to foster a sense of purpose and motivation among students, as well
  as provide valuable experience that can enhance their employability after graduation.


  By implementing these actions, we can help to create a more equitable and inclusive
  higher education system that supports students from disadvantaged backgrounds to
  succeed and contribute to our collective prosperity and understanding.'

original_scenario: 'Lillian had always known that her intellectual abilities would
  be her ticket out of poverty. Her parents, both farmers in a small village in Subsaharan
  Africa, had always encouraged her to read and learn as much as possible. And so,
  she had spent most of her childhood and teenage years buried in books or studying
  in the school library.


  With her exceptional grades, Lillian was awarded a scholarship to study Environmental
  Science at the university in the city. She saw this as an opportunity to not only
  better herself but also to make a positive impact on her community. Environmental
  degradation was a critical issue in her region, and she was determined to use her
  newfound knowledge to help address it.


  However, shortly after she arrived on campus, Lillian realized that her intellectual
  abilities alone were not enough to help her succeed in this new environment. She
  struggled to adjust to the fast-paced, competitive nature of university life, and
  found herself feeling increasingly isolated and overwhelmed.


  To make matters worse, she discovered that her scholarship did not cover all of
  her expenses, and she was forced to take on a part-time job to make ends meet. This
  meant that she had less time to study and attend classes, and her grades began to
  suffer.


  As the pressure mounted, Lillian found herself questioning whether she had made
  the right decision in pursuing her dreams. But even as she struggled, she knew that
  giving up was not an option. She was determined to succeed, not just for herself,
  but for her community and for the environment that she was so passionate about.


  With the help of a supportive professor and a group of like-minded students, Lillian
  was able to find her footing and regain her confidence. She learned to balance her
  academic and personal life, and developed a network of friends and mentors who encouraged
  and supported her. And in the end, she graduated with honors, ready to embark on
  the next chapter of her life as an intellectual and an environmental advocate.'
