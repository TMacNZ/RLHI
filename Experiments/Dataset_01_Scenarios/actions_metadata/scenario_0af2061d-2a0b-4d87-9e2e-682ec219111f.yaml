original_scenario: 'As the presidential delegation from a powerful country arrived
  in North Africa, they were greeted by a group of angry students protesting outside
  the gates of a local university. The reason? A technological failure had occurred,
  causing widespread annoyance amongst the student population.


  The educational institution had recently upgraded its systems to include state-of-the-art
  technology that would allow for seamless online learning and communication. However,
  a glitch had caused the system to crash, leaving students unable to access their
  coursework or communicate with their professors.


  As the protests grew louder, the delegation realized that the situation was rapidly
  escalating and needed to be addressed immediately. They quickly arranged a meeting
  with the university''s administration to resolve the issue.


  After hours of discussion and troubleshooting, the source of the technological failure
  was eventually identified and resolved. The students were finally able to access
  their coursework and continue their studies without any further interruptions.


  Despite the annoyance caused by the technological failure, the delegation was impressed
  with the swift action taken by the university''s administration to resolve the issue.
  They left North Africa with a newfound respect for the resilience and ingenuity
  of the local people.'
