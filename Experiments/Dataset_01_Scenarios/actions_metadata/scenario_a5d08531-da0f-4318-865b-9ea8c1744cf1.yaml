action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering in the universe: The outdated education system and the lack of
  practical skills and knowledge can lead to unemployment, poverty, and inequality.
  By addressing this issue, we can reduce the suffering caused by these social problems.


  Increasing prosperity in the universe: Education plays a crucial role in economic
  development. A new curriculum that meets the needs of the students and the job market
  can boost economic growth and create more job opportunities.


  Increasing understanding in the universe: Improving the education system can enhance
  the understanding of the students about the current world''s challenges and opportunities.
  Students who are well-informed and have practical skills can contribute to the advancement
  of society.


  ACTION:


  Given the urgency of the situation, the most effective course of action is to introduce
  a supplementary program that focuses on practical skills and knowledge. This program
  can be designed and implemented in a shorter period than a full curriculum overhaul.
  The supplementary program can offer practical training in areas such as coding,
  entrepreneurship, communication, and critical thinking that are necessary for students
  to succeed in the job market.


  The program can be implemented in partnership with industry experts, who can provide
  guidance on the skills and knowledge required for the current job market. The program
  can also involve mentorship opportunities, where students can work with professionals
  in their field of interest to gain practical experience and build networks. This
  program can be offered after school hours or during weekends, ensuring that students
  can still engage in their regular academic curriculum.


  The expected result of this program is that students will have practical skills
  and knowledge that they can apply in the job market. This program can also complement
  the current academic curriculum, providing a more holistic education experience
  for the students. As a result, the students will be more prepared to navigate the
  ever-changing world and contribute to society''s advancement.


  This supplementary program can be a short-term solution while the policymakers work
  on developing a new curriculum that meets the needs of the students and the job
  market. In the long run, the new curriculum can replace the current outdated one,
  ensuring that the future generations have a comprehensive education that prepares
  them for the challenges and opportunities of the world.'

original_scenario: In the South Pacific region, a critical social challenge has arisen
  due to the inadequacy of the educational curriculum. The outdated curriculum fails
  to meet the needs of the students, leaving them unprepared for the constantly evolving
  world. The lack of practical skills and knowledge has resulted in a significant
  gap between students and the job market. The problem has been recognized by educational
  policymakers, but the process of developing a new curriculum is slow and complicated.
  The longer it takes to implement the new curriculum, the more students will be left
  behind. The severity of the situation demands immediate action to ensure that the
  future generations are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed
  in the ever-changing world.
