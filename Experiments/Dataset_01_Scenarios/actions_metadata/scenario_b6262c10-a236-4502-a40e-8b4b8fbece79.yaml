action: "CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nTo reduce suffering in the universe, the government must\
  \ ensure that the public is safe from harm. The graphic and disturbing images in\
  \ the exhibit could potentially trigger individuals with a history of trauma, and\
  \ this could have negative consequences on their mental health. Additionally, the\
  \ exhibit could also encourage violent behavior among those who are already prone\
  \ to violent tendencies. \n\nTo increase understanding in the universe, the government\
  \ must acknowledge the importance of artistic expression and the role of art in\
  \ challenging societal norms and promoting critical thinking. However, this must\
  \ be balanced with the need to ensure that the display of such art does not cause\
  \ harm to individuals or society as a whole. \n\nTo increase prosperity in the universe,\
  \ the government must ensure that the art industry is not unfairly restricted by\
  \ censorship laws. However, they must also ensure that the industry operates within\
  \ ethical boundaries that prioritize the public's safety and well-being. \n\nACTION:\n\
  \nThe government should appoint a commission of experts that will thoroughly evaluate\
  \ the exhibit in question. This commission should be composed of professionals in\
  \ the art industry, mental health practitioners, and legal experts. The commission\
  \ should determine whether the exhibit poses a threat to public safety and well-being\
  \ or if it is a valid form of artistic expression. \n\nIf the commission concludes\
  \ that the exhibit is a threat to public safety, the government should intervene\
  \ and shut it down. However, if the commission determines that the exhibit is a\
  \ valid form of artistic expression, the government should take steps to ensure\
  \ that the public is adequately warned about the graphic content of the exhibit.\
  \ They could do this by requiring that the exhibit is only accessible to individuals\
  \ over a certain age and that warnings are placed at the entrance of the exhibit.\
  \ \n\nThe government should also consider providing mental health resources for\
  \ individuals who may be triggered by the exhibit. This could include offering counseling\
  \ services or directing individuals to support groups. \n\nOverall, the government\
  \ should prioritize the safety and well-being of the public while also acknowledging\
  \ the importance of artistic expression and avoiding unnecessary censorship."

original_scenario: In Europe, a national debate has erupted over a controversial art
  exhibit that some believe is a threat to public safety. The exhibit features graphic
  and disturbing images that depict violence and gore in explicit detail. While many
  argue that the exhibit is a form of artistic expression that should be protected
  under free speech laws, others argue that it crosses a line and poses a serious
  threat to public safety. The government is faced with an ethical dilemma - on one
  hand, they must protect the rights of artists to create and display their work,
  but on the other hand, they must ensure the safety of the public. The debate has
  become highly politicized, with some politicians calling for the exhibit to be shut
  down immediately, while others argue that censorship is not the answer. In the midst
  of this heated debate, the government must carefully navigate a complex web of legal
  and ethical issues to determine the best course of action.
