original_scenario: It was a beautiful summer day and the chosen family, a group of
  close friends who had formed a tight-knit community over the years, had planned
  a picnic in the park. They had been looking forward to this day for weeks and had
  spent hours preparing food and drinks, packing blankets and games, and making sure
  everyone would have a great time. As they were setting up their picnic spot, one
  of the members, a young woman named Lily, suddenly fell to the ground, clutching
  her hip in pain. The others rushed to her side, trying to help her up, but she couldn't
  move without crying out. They quickly realized that Lily had dislocated her hip,
  likely from a previous injury that had gone unnoticed. Panic set in as they realized
  they were in the middle of the park with no medical equipment or expertise. They
  called 911 and waited anxiously for the ambulance to arrive, trying to keep Lily
  calm and comfortable. The incident served as a reminder of the importance of being
  prepared for emergencies and looking out for each other in their chosen family.
