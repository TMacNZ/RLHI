original_scenario: 'The raw power of interstellar travel had always been a double-edged
  sword, capable of accomplishing incredible feats but also fraught with disruptive
  technological failures. As the Eurasian spacecraft hurtled through the vast expanse
  of space, the crew suddenly found themselves facing a catastrophic malfunction.
  The raw energy coursing through the ship''s systems had overloaded, causing the
  engines to shut down and leaving the vessel adrift in the vacuum of space. With
  no means of communication and dwindling supplies, the crew faced a daunting challenge:
  repair the technological failure before it was too late. The fate of their mission,
  and their lives, hung precariously in the balance.'
