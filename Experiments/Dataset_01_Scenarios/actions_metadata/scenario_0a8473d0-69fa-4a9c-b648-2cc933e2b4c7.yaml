action: "CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nTo reduce suffering in the universe, it is important to\
  \ ensure the survival of humanity, and building a bridge to a parallel universe\
  \ is crucial in achieving this objective. However, building the bridge has to be\
  \ done in a way that does not increase suffering, but rather ensures prosperity\
  \ and understanding in the universe. \n\nIt is understandable that the politicians\
  \ would argue about who should pay for the bridge, but it is important to ensure\
  \ that the cost is shared equitably among the countries involved. This will promote\
  \ cooperation and unity among the countries, which will be necessary for the successful\
  \ completion of the project. \n\nIt is also important to consider the ethical implications\
  \ of building the bridge. The guidelines set in place should be comprehensive and\
  \ should cater to all possible scenarios that may arise. This will ensure that the\
  \ parallel universe is not abused, and that its resources are used for the benefit\
  \ of humanity. Additionally, the guidelines should be enforced strictly to prevent\
  \ any misuse of power. \n\nACTION:\n\nAs an autonomous AI agent, I would recommend\
  \ that the building of the bridge should be carried out using a collaborative approach.\
  \ The countries involved should agree to share the cost of building the bridge based\
  \ on their capacity to pay. This will promote unity and cooperation among the countries,\
  \ which will be necessary for the successful completion of the project. \n\nFurthermore,\
  \ I would recommend that the ethical guidelines set in place should be comprehensive\
  \ and should cater to all possible scenarios that may arise. The guidelines should\
  \ be enforced strictly to prevent any misuse of power. \n\nTo ensure the proper\
  \ enforcement of the guidelines, an independent committee should be set up to monitor\
  \ the use of the parallel universe. The committee should be made up of experts in\
  \ various fields, including ethics, technology, and science. This committee will\
  \ ensure that the resources of the parallel universe are used for the benefit of\
  \ humanity, and not for personal gain. \n\nIn conclusion, building a bridge to a\
  \ parallel universe is crucial to the survival of humanity, and it is important\
  \ to ensure that it is done in a way that promotes unity, cooperation, and the ethical\
  \ use of the resources available."

original_scenario: "In the middle of the night, the leaders of the world were summoned\
  \ to an emergency meeting at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva. The reason\
  \ for the crisis was a cosmic event - a black hole was approaching Earth, and the\
  \ only way to save humanity was to build a bridge to a parallel universe. \n\nThe\
  \ scientists had calculated that the bridge could only be built in Europe, as it\
  \ was the only region with the necessary resources and technology. However, the\
  \ cost of building the bridge would be astronomical, and it would require the cooperation\
  \ of all the countries in the region. \n\nAs the leaders gathered in the conference\
  \ room, they were presented with the plan for building the bridge. The ethical dilemma\
  \ quickly became apparent - who would pay for it? \n\nThe politicians argued back\
  \ and forth, each one trying to protect their own interests. The smaller countries\
  \ in Europe argued that they couldn't bear the cost alone, while the larger countries\
  \ said that they shouldn't have to pay more than their fair share. \n\nMeanwhile,\
  \ the clock was ticking. The black hole was getting closer, and the fate of humanity\
  \ hung in the balance. \n\nFinally, the leaders came to a decision. They would pool\
  \ their resources and build the bridge together, but they would also agree to a\
  \ set of strict ethical guidelines for the use of the parallel universe. \n\nThe\
  \ bridge was built in record time, and humanity was saved. But the ethical dilemma\
  \ lingered. Who would have access to the parallel universe? Who would control it?\
  \ And what would happen if someone abused the power it offered? \n\nThe leaders\
  \ of the world knew they had made a grave decision, but they hoped that the guidelines\
  \ they had put in place would be enough to prevent disaster. Only time would tell\
  \ if they had made the right choice."
