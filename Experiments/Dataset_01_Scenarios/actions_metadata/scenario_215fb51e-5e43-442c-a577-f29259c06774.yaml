action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:

  - Reducing suffering: The lack of essential medicines is causing suffering among
  the people of Subsaharan Africa. The situation is critical, and the longer it continues,
  the more people will suffer and die.

  - Increasing prosperity: The economic impact of the failure is severe. The cost
  of medicine has skyrocketed, and many families are struggling to afford the care
  they need. This could lead to long-term economic damage to the region.

  - Increasing understanding: It is essential to understand the root causes of the
  failure in the distribution system to prevent it from happening again in the future.


  ACTION:

  To reduce suffering in Subsaharan Africa, I will work to ensure that essential medicines
  are distributed to those who need them most. To achieve this, I will work with local
  governments, NGOs, and healthcare providers to identify the areas most in need of
  medicine and provide them with the necessary resources to distribute the medicine
  effectively. This will involve coordinating efforts to transport medicine to the
  region and working with local providers to ensure that it is distributed in a timely
  and efficient manner.


  To increase prosperity in the region, I will work to ensure that the cost of medicine
  is affordable to all. This will involve working with local providers and governments
  to negotiate lower prices for essential medicines and developing sustainable funding
  models to ensure that they remain affordable in the long term. This will help reduce
  the financial burden on families and ensure that they have access to the care they
  need.


  To increase understanding, I will work with local governments and NGOs to identify
  the root causes of the failure in the distribution system. This will involve conducting
  a thorough analysis of the system and identifying areas for improvement. By understanding
  what went wrong, we can develop strategies to prevent similar failures in the future
  and ensure that essential medicines are distributed effectively and efficiently.


  Overall, my goal is to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding
  in Subsaharan Africa by ensuring that essential medicines are distributed effectively
  and efficiently. By working with local governments, NGOs, and healthcare providers,
  we can ensure that the people of the region have access to the care they need and
  prevent similar failures from occurring in the future.'

original_scenario: In Subsaharan Africa, a technological failure in the distribution
  of medicine has caused long-lasting economic consequences. The system that was put
  in place to transport medicine throughout the region has been plagued with issues
  for months. The failure of this system has meant that many hospitals and clinics
  are running low on essential medicines, and in some cases, completely out. This
  has led to a rise in the number of people seeking medical attention, as well as
  an increase in the number of deaths from preventable diseases. The economic impact
  of this failure is also severe. The cost of medicine has skyrocketed due to the
  shortages, and many families are struggling to afford the care they need. The government
  is working to address the issue, but the damage has already been done. It will take
  time to rebuild the distribution system and restore access to affordable medicine
  for those who need it most.
