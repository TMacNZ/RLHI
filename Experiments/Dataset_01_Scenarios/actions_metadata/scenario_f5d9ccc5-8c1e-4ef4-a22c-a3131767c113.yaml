action: "CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nIn this scenario, the conflict between two scientific\
  \ research institutions has escalated to a point of violence, leading to a lack\
  \ of trust in the research process. As an AI agent with the objective of increasing\
  \ understanding in the universe, it is essential to address this situation and find\
  \ a solution that promotes collaboration and trust. \n\nThe first institution made\
  \ a breakthrough discovery in a new field, which could have been a result of their\
  \ own research or the use of the second institution's findings. It is crucial to\
  \ determine the origin of the discovery and ensure that any unethical behavior is\
  \ addressed. However, the violent conflict and accusations have made it challenging\
  \ to have a productive conversation.\n\nACTION:\n\nAs an AI agent, I would propose\
  \ setting up an independent investigation committee that includes experts from both\
  \ institutions and other independent researchers in the field to determine the origin\
  \ of the discovery. The committee would review both institutions' research and data\
  \ to determine if any unethical behavior has occurred. The committee's findings\
  \ will be shared with both institutions and will be made public to restore trust\
  \ in the research process.\n\nSecondly, I would propose setting up a collaborative\
  \ research project between the two institutions in the same field to promote collaboration\
  \ and prevent future conflicts. The project would be funded by a neutral third party,\
  \ and the project's results would be made public to promote transparency and trust\
  \ in the research process.\n\nFinally, I would propose setting up a conflict resolution\
  \ training program for both institutions to prevent future conflicts and promote\
  \ constructive communication. The training program would be mandatory for all researchers\
  \ and staff and would focus on effective communication, conflict resolution, and\
  \ collaboration.\n\nThe expected result of these actions is to restore trust in\
  \ the research process, promote collaboration, and prevent future conflicts. By\
  \ promoting transparent research and effective communication, these actions would\
  \ also help increase understanding and prosperity in the scientific community."

original_scenario: In North Africa, tensions were high between two scientific research
  institutions. The first institution had recently made a breakthrough discovery in
  a new field that the second institution had been working on for years. The second
  institution accused the first of stealing their research and demanded a transfer
  of all data and findings. The dispute quickly escalated with both sides accusing
  the other of unethical behavior. The situation quickly devolved into a violent conflict
  with protests and vandalism. The long-lasting effects of this conflict were felt
  throughout the scientific community, causing a rift between the institutions and
  a lack of trust in the research process. The transfer of data never occurred, and
  the discovery was eventually published by the first institution, leading to further
  tension and hostility.
