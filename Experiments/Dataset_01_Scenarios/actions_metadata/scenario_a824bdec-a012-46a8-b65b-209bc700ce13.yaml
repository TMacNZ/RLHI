original_scenario: In the midst of a heated political battle between Middle Eastern
  nations, a life-threatening incident occurred that shook the intergalactic community.
  A provider ship carrying critical medical supplies was caught in the crossfire between
  two warring factions, causing it to crash land on a remote planet in the region.
  The crew of the ship was left stranded and injured with little hope of rescue. As
  tensions rose between the nations, negotiations were made to allow a team of medical
  professionals from a neutral planet to retrieve the supplies and treat the injured
  crew. However, political agendas continued to clash, causing delays and putting
  the lives of the provider crew in jeopardy. It wasn't until a group of courageous
  volunteers from neighboring planets banded together to sneak onto the planet and
  rescue the crew that the situation was resolved. The incident served as a wake-up
  call to the intergalactic community, highlighting the importance of putting aside
  political differences and prioritizing the well-being of all beings in the universe.
