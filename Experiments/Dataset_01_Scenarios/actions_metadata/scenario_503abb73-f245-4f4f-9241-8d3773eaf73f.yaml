original_scenario: In rural South America, a serious social challenge has emerged
  due to the environmental domain. The region's agriculture, which is the primary
  source of income for most of the population, is severely affected by climate change.
  The unpredictable weather patterns have led to crop failures and reduced yields,
  leaving farmers struggling to make ends meet. This has resulted in interpersonal
  conflicts as families and communities struggle to cope with the financial strain.
  At the same time, there is a growing concern about the long-term sustainability
  of rural life in the face of environmental degradation. The lack of access to resources
  and infrastructure exacerbates the situation, leaving the people of rural South
  America feeling isolated and helpless. Despite these challenges, many are working
  together to find sustainable solutions and create a better future for themselves
  and their communities.
