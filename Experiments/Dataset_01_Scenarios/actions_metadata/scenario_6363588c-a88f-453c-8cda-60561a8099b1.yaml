action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering in the universe:

  The financial crisis in Asia''s educational system has led to many students being
  unable to continue their education, which could result in long-term suffering. The
  inability to pay tuition fees could also lead to teachers and staff being unable
  to support themselves and their families, causing further suffering.


  Increasing prosperity in the universe:

  The financial crisis in Asia''s educational system could lead to a decrease in the
  quality of education provided, which could have long-term consequences for the prosperity
  of the region. The inability to pay teachers and staff could lead to a decrease
  in the quality of education, leading to a decrease in the number of skilled workers
  in the region.


  Increasing understanding in the universe:

  The financial crisis in Asia''s educational system could result in a decrease in
  the number of students who can access education, leading to a decrease in the level
  of understanding in the region. The decrease in the quality of education could also
  lead to a decrease in the level of understanding of various subjects.


  ACTION:


  To address the financial crisis in Asia''s educational system, I would suggest the
  following actions:


  1. Providing financial assistance:

  To prevent the closure of schools and universities, financial assistance could be
  provided to institutions to help them pay their teachers and staff. This financial
  assistance could be provided by the government or through private funding.


  2. Reducing tuition fees:

  To ensure that students can continue their education, tuition fees could be reduced.
  This could be achieved by providing subsidies to schools and universities or by
  implementing a scholarship program for students who are unable to pay the full tuition
  fee.


  3. Increasing awareness:

  To increase awareness about the financial crisis in the educational system, a campaign
  could be launched to inform the public about the situation. This campaign could
  be conducted through various media channels, including social media, to reach a
  wider audience.


  4. Encouraging online education:

  To ensure that students can continue their education despite the financial crisis,
  online education could be encouraged. This would allow students to access education
  from their homes, reducing the need for them to pay for transportation and accommodation.


  5. Promoting entrepreneurship:

  To increase the prosperity of the region, entrepreneurship could be promoted. This
  could be achieved by providing training and resources to individuals who are interested
  in starting their businesses. This would create job opportunities, leading to an
  increase in the number of skilled workers in the region.


  The expected result of these actions is that schools and universities will be able
  to stay open, and students will be able to continue their education. By reducing
  tuition fees, more students will be able to access education, leading to an increase
  in the level of understanding in the region. By promoting entrepreneurship, the
  prosperity of the region will increase, leading to a more stable future for the
  educational system.'

original_scenario: In Asia, a dangerous financial crisis had hit the educational domain.
  The crisis had spread equally across the continent, leaving many schools and universities
  struggling to stay afloat. The sudden economic downturn had resulted in a decrease
  in enrollment, leaving many institutions struggling to pay their teachers and staff.
  The situation had become dire, with some schools being forced to shut down entirely.
  The impact of this crisis on the educational sector was severe, with many students
  forced to drop out due to the inability to pay tuition fees. The future of the educational
  system in Asia was uncertain, and urgent measures were needed to address the crisis
  and prevent further damage.
