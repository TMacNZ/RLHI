  counselor who can help them identify their strengths, skills, and interests, and
  guide them towards career opportunities that align with their goals.

  to training courses and development programs that could enhance their skills and
  make them more competitive in the job market.

  professionals in their industry or related fields who could offer mentorship, advice,
  and referrals for job opportunities.

original_scenario: As a professional in Europe, I've always been intrigued by how
  much luck can play into one's career path. Some people seem to have all the good
  fortune, landing one opportunity after another without much effort. Others, like
  myself, struggle to catch a break despite our best efforts. It's a social challenge
  that most of us face at some point in our lives, and it can be frustrating to watch
  others succeed while we feel stuck in place. In my case, I've turned to my spiritual
  beliefs to help me cope with the ups and downs of my professional journey. I believe
  that everything happens for a reason, and that my struggles are simply a test of
  my strength and resilience. By staying grounded in my faith, I'm able to keep pushing
  forward and trusting that my luck will eventually turn around.
