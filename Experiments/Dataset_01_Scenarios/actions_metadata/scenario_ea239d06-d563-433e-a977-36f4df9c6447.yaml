action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering: This situation does not involve any direct suffering, but if
  the wrong decision is made, it could potentially lead to harm to one or both of
  the friends.


  Increasing prosperity: The current situation is negatively impacting the prosperity
  of both friends, as one friend is taking a larger share of the profits at the expense
  of the other.


  Increasing understanding: It is important to consider the perspective of both friends
  and to understand the underlying reasons for why one friend felt justified in taking
  a larger share of the profits. It is also important to understand the potential
  consequences of confronting the friend.


  ACTION:


  The best course of action in this situation would be to confront the friend who
  is taking a larger share of the profits. The confronting friend should approach
  the situation calmly and explain their concerns and how they discovered the scheme.
  They should also express their commitment to the partnership and their desire to
  find a mutually beneficial solution.


  It would be important to listen to the other friend''s perspective and try to understand
  why they felt justified in taking a larger share of the profits. Perhaps there are
  underlying issues that need to be addressed, such as a perceived imbalance in workload
  or responsibilities.


  Ultimately, the goal should be to come to a fair and equitable solution that benefits
  both friends and maintains the integrity of their partnership. This may involve
  renegotiating the terms of their partnership or seeking outside mediation.


  The desired result of this action would be a fair and equitable distribution of
  profits that allows both friends to prosper and maintain their friendship. Additionally,
  this action would promote trust and integrity within their partnership and potentially
  serve as an example for others in their community.'

original_scenario: In a small village in rural South Asia, two close friends run a
  small grocery store together. One of the friends, however, has been secretly calculating
  the profits and taking a larger share for himself. The other friend begins to suspect
  that something is amiss when he notices that the profits seem lower than what they
  should be. After doing some investigating, he discovers his friend's scheme and
  is faced with an ethical dilemma. He wants to confront his friend about the unfair
  distribution of profits, but he knows that it will create a disruptive situation
  and potentially damage their friendship. On the other hand, he cannot continue to
  allow his friend to take advantage of their partnership. As he weighs his options,
  he realizes that this is not just a matter of money, but also of trust and integrity.
