original_scenario: Upon receiving her monthly credit card statement, Sarah realized
  that she had overspent on her recent vacation with friends. Although the amount
  was not significant, it still put her in a financial crisis as she had already budgeted
  for the month. As a part of her cultural upbringing, Sarah believed in being financially
  responsible and never relying on credit card debt. She immediately took action by
  cutting back on unnecessary expenses and creating a strict budget plan to pay off
  the balance as soon as possible. Despite the minor setback, Sarah felt proud of
  herself for taking control of the situation and sticking to her cultural values
  of financial responsibility.
