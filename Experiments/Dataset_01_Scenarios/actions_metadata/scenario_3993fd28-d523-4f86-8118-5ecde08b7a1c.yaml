action: "CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nReducing suffering: The deadly virus outbreak on the South\
  \ Asian colony of New Delhi has caused immense suffering amongst the colony inhabitants.\
  \ It is imperative to find a solution to contain the virus and prevent further loss\
  \ of life.\n\nIncreasing prosperity: The deadly virus outbreak has created a social\
  \ challenge, leading to a divide between the mutated individuals and the non-mutated\
  \ ones. It is crucial to find a way to bring the colony together to work towards\
  \ a common goal of survival.\n\nIncreasing understanding: The genetic mutation found\
  \ predominantly in the local population that provides immunity to the virus is an\
  \ important discovery. Understanding the genetic mutation can help develop better\
  \ preventive measures and cures for future outbreaks.\n\nACTION:\n\nThe first step\
  \ to address this crisis is to provide medical supplies and resources to the colony.\
  \ We will work with the interstellar travel authorities to mobilize resources and\
  \ medical teams to the colony as soon as possible.\n\nSecondly, we will work towards\
  \ educating the non-mutated individuals about the genetic mutation found in the\
  \ local population. This will help reduce the divide between the mutated and non-mutated\
  \ individuals and facilitate cooperation towards a common goal of survival.\n\n\
  Thirdly, we will set up a research facility on the colony to study the genetic mutation\
  \ found in the local population. This will allow us to better understand the mutation\
  \ and develop better preventive measures and cures for future outbreaks.\n\nLastly,\
  \ we will work with the local authorities to ensure the safety and protection of\
  \ the mutated individuals. We will set up quarantine zones and provide security\
  \ to prevent targeting by non-mutated individuals who believe they hold the key\
  \ to their own survival. \n\nThe desired result of these actions is to ensure the\
  \ survival of all colony inhabitants, reduce suffering, increase understanding of\
  \ the genetic mutation and develop better preventive measures and cures for future\
  \ outbreaks. This will lead to an increase in prosperity in the colony and strengthen\
  \ interstellar travel's ability to handle crises in the future."

original_scenario: In the year 2076, humanity has finally achieved interstellar travel,
  with colonies established on planets beyond our solar system. However, a catastrophic
  event has occurred on the South Asian colony of New Delhi. A deadly virus has spread
  rapidly through the population, with a mortality rate of 99.9%. The virus seems
  to affect all races and ages except those with a certain genetic mutation found
  predominantly in the local population. This has led to a social challenge as the
  mutated individuals are now the only hope for the survival of the colony. With interstellar
  travel still in its infancy, the resources and medical supplies needed to combat
  the virus are limited, and the mutated individuals are being targeted by those who
  believe they hold the key to their own survival. As tensions rise, the colony faces
  a dilemma of how to ensure the survival of all, except without sacrificing the few
  for the many.
