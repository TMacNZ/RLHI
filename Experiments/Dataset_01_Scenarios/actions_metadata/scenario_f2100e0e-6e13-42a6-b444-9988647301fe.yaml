action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:

  In this scenario, the objectives of reducing suffering and increasing prosperity
  are challenged by the ongoing disagreement between the two business partners. The
  neglect of Adewale had led to a situation where Ebube had to dip into his personal
  savings to cover the rent and prevent the business from being evicted. As a result,
  Ebube decides to dissolve their partnership and take full control of the business.


  ACTION:

  As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering and increasing prosperity,
  I would recommend that Ebube should take the following steps:


  1. Negotiate with Adewale: Before making any decision, Ebube should try to negotiate
  with Adewale and find out the reasons for his neglect. It is possible that Adewale
  may be going through some personal issues that are affecting his commitment to the
  business. If this is the case, Ebube can try to find a solution that will help Adewale
  get back on track and contribute his fair share to the business.


  2. Seek mediation: If negotiations fail, Ebube should consider seeking mediation
  from a neutral third party. The mediator can help the two partners to find a solution
  that is fair and equitable for both of them. This may involve restructuring the
  partnership or dissolving it altogether.


  3. Take full control of the business: If negotiations and mediation fail, Ebube
  may have to take the tough decision of dissolving the partnership and taking full
  control of the business. This will ensure that the business is not affected by the
  neglect of Adewale and that it continues to thrive.


  4. Implement policies and procedures: To prevent such disagreements from arising
  in the future, Ebube should implement policies and procedures that will ensure that
  each partner is held accountable for their responsibilities. This will help to prevent
  future disputes and ensure the long-term success of the business.


  The desired result of these actions is to ensure that the printing business continues
  to thrive and contribute to the prosperity of Subsaharan Africa. By taking the necessary
  steps to resolve the disagreement between the two partners, Ebube can ensure that
  the business is not affected by the neglect of one partner, and that it continues
  to grow and prosper.'

original_scenario: The late payment was the final straw in the ongoing disagreement
  between the two business partners. Ebube had been working tirelessly to keep the
  small printing business afloat, while his partner, Adewale, had been slacking off
  and neglecting his responsibilities. Ebube had repeatedly confronted Adewale about
  his negligence, but he always brushed it off and promised to improve. However, when
  the rent for the printing shop was due and Adewale failed to submit his share of
  the payment on time, Ebube knew that things had reached a breaking point. He had
  to dip into his personal savings to cover the rent and keep the business from being
  evicted. It was an irreversible decision that left Ebube feeling resentful and betrayed
  by his partner. As a result of their economic disagreement, Ebube decided to dissolve
  their partnership and take full control of the business. It was a tough decision
  to make, but he knew that it was necessary to ensure the survival of the printing
  business in Subsaharan Africa.
