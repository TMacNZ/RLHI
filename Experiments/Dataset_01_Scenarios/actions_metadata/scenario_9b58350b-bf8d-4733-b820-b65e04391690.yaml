original_scenario: 'As a teacher in a small Pacific island community, I never imagined
  that my life would be transformed by a single incident that occurred in my classroom.
  It was a typical day, and my students were working on their assignments when suddenly
  there was a loud crash.


  I rushed over to the source of the noise and found one of my students, a bright
  and ambitious young girl, lying on the floor in agony. It turned out that she had
  tripped and hit her head on a nearby desk. I immediately called for medical assistance,
  and the girl was rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment.


  The severity of the incident hit me hard, and I couldn''t help but feel responsible
  for what had happened. I spent many sleepless nights wondering if I could have done
  anything differently to prevent the accident.


  Once the girl was stabilized, I visited her in the hospital. As we talked, I realized
  that this incident had transformed our relationship. We had always had a good rapport,
  but now there was a deeper level of understanding between us. I learned about her
  dreams and aspirations, and she confided in me about her fears and concerns.


  As the days passed, I watched her transform from a bright and ambitious student
  to a fighter, determined to overcome the challenges that lay ahead. She returned
  to school with a newfound sense of purpose, and her classmates rallied around her
  in support.


  The incident had a profound impact on me as well. It made me realize the importance
  of safety in the classroom and the responsibility that I have as a teacher to provide
  a safe and nurturing environment for my students. It also reminded me of the power
  of compassion and empathy in building meaningful relationships with those around
  us.


  In the end, the incident that had started as a serious accident had transformed
  into a powerful educational experience for everyone involved.'
