action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering and increasing prosperity are both critical objectives in this
  scenario. The shortage of medical supplies is causing immense suffering, and the
  government''s priority should be to ensure that everyone has access to essential
  medical resources. However, the situation also presents an ethical dilemma as the
  private hospital has a right to its property, and seizing their supplies could cause
  economic implications.


  The government must consider the overall impact of its decision in the long-term,
  not just the short-term. While seizing the supplies may provide immediate relief,
  it could also create lasting damage to the private sector, reducing overall prosperity
  in the region. It may also cause resentment among private entities, potentially
  leading to future reluctance to invest in the region, further reducing prosperity.


  On the other hand, allowing the private hospital to keep the supplies could lead
  to a significant loss of life, causing immense suffering. This would be a clear
  violation of the objective to reduce suffering in the universe.


  ACTION:


  The best course of action in this scenario is for the government to negotiate with
  the private hospital to secure the medical supplies needed to address the shortage.
  The government should explain the severity of the situation and the importance of
  everyone having access to essential medical resources. They should also offer financial
  compensation to the private hospital for the supplies, taking into consideration
  the hospital''s investment in acquiring the equipment.


  If negotiations fail, the government may have to consider other options, such as
  invoking emergency powers to seize the supplies. However, this should be a last
  resort and only done after all other options have been exhausted.


  The desired result of this action is to ensure that everyone has access to essential
  medical resources, reducing suffering and saving lives. Additionally, negotiating
  with the private hospital rather than seizing the supplies outright will maintain
  the region''s prosperity, preventing any negative economic implications.'

original_scenario: 'In the Pacific region, a life-threatening situation has arisen
  that poses an ethical dilemma with economic implications. The nation is facing a
  shortage of essential medical supplies due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the government
  is scrambling to secure enough resources to keep people alive. However, a wealthy
  private hospital has been hoarding much-needed medical equipment, leaving public
  hospitals struggling to meet the demand. The ethical question arises: should the
  government seize these supplies and distribute them to public facilities, potentially
  violating property rights and causing backlash from the private sector? Or should
  they let the private hospital keep the supplies, potentially allowing patients to
  die due to lack of resources? The situation is dire, and the consequences of either
  decision could be catastrophic.'
