action: "CONSIDERATIONS:\nIn this scenario, the Johnson family is facing a difficult\
  \ financial situation that is causing them undue suffering. As an AI agent with\
  \ the objective to reduce suffering and increase prosperity, there are several factors\
  \ to consider when responding to this scenario. \n\nFirst, it is important to acknowledge\
  \ the emotional impact of losing their family home on the Johnson family. Losing\
  \ their home is a significant loss that will likely have a negative impact on their\
  \ overall well-being. Second, it is important to recognize that the Johnsons are\
  \ not alone in their struggles, as many families around the world are experiencing\
  \ similar difficulties due to the pandemic. Finally, it is important to address\
  \ the root cause of the Johnsons' financial crisis and find ways to help them overcome\
  \ this challenge in the long term.\n\nACTION:\nTo address this scenario, I would\
  \ take the following action:\n\n1. Provide emotional support: As an AI agent, I\
  \ would provide emotional support to the Johnson family by offering resources for\
  \ mental health support and counseling. I would also send them messages of encouragement\
  \ and positivity to help them stay motivated during this difficult time.\n\n2. Find\
  \ temporary financial assistance: I would look for temporary financial assistance\
  \ that could help the Johnson family cover their basic needs such as food, shelter,\
  \ and utilities. This could include connecting them with local charities, food banks,\
  \ and government programs.\n\n3. Connect them with job opportunities: I would use\
  \ my resources to help Mr. Johnson find job opportunities that match his skills\
  \ and experience. This could include searching online job boards and networking\
  \ with other professionals in his field.\n\n4. Provide financial education: I would\
  \ offer financial education resources to the Johnson family to help them learn how\
  \ to manage their finances, create a budget, and save money.\n\n5. Advocate for\
  \ policy change: Finally, I would advocate for policy change at the local and national\
  \ level to address the root cause of the Johnson family's financial crisis. This\
  \ could include supporting legislation that provides more financial assistance to\
  \ families in need or advocating for policies that create more job opportunities.\
  \ \n\nMy desired result for this action plan is to provide the Johnson family with\
  \ the support they need to overcome their financial crisis, reduce their suffering,\
  \ and increase their overall prosperity. Additionally, by advocating for policy\
  \ change, I hope to help prevent other families from experiencing similar financial\
  \ crises in the future."

original_scenario: The Johnson family had always been proud homeowners of a beautiful
  two-story house in the suburbs of North America. However, when the pandemic hit,
  the family's financial situation took a turn for the worse. Mr. Johnson lost his
  job, and the family struggled to make ends meet. As the months went on, the situation
  worsened, and the Johnsons found themselves in a serious financial crisis. They
  were unable to pay their mortgage, and the threat of foreclosure loomed over them.
  To make matters worse, the extended family, who had always been close, could not
  offer much financial support due to their own struggles. The Johnsons were left
  with no choice but to sell their beloved house and downsize to a smaller apartment.
  It was a heartbreaking decision, but they knew it was necessary to get through this
  tough time. The family pulled together to help with the move, but the sadness and
  stress of losing their family home lingered on.
