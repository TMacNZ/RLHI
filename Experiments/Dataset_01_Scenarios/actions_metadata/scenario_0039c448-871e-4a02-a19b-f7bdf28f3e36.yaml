original_scenario: There was a looming sense of danger as the dry winds blew across
  the arid landscape of North Africa. The scorching sun beat down on the parched earth,
  causing the ground to crack and crumble beneath the villagers' feet. Suddenly, there
  was a deafening roar as a massive sandstorm swept through the area, engulfing everything
  in its path. Visibility was reduced to zero as the wind howled and the sand whipped
  against their skin, stinging like a thousand needles. The villagers huddled together
  in fear, trying to shield themselves from the onslaught of sand and debris. They
  knew that these storms could last for hours, and they prayed that they would survive
  this one. As the storm finally subsided, they emerged from their shelter to find
  their homes and fields buried under several feet of sand. It would take weeks of
  hard work to dig themselves out and rebuild their lives, but they were grateful
  to have made it through alive.
