action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering in the universe requires us to address the current economic crisis
  caused by the drought in Subsaharan Africa. This crisis has caused many individuals
  and families to suffer from unemployment, lack of resources, and poverty. Therefore,
  we need to find a solution that will help these communities recover from the current
  crisis and prevent future crises.


  Increasing prosperity in the universe requires us to find a sustainable solution
  that will not only help these communities recover from the current crisis but also
  ensure their long-term survival. We need to find a solution that will enable these
  communities to be self-sufficient and resilient to future natural disasters.


  Increasing understanding in the universe requires us to understand the root cause
  of the drought and its impact on the local environment and economy. We need to gather
  data and information that will help us understand the factors that contributed to
  the drought and develop measures to prevent similar disasters in the future.


  ACTION:


  To address the current economic crisis caused by the drought in Subsaharan Africa,
  I propose the following actions:


  1. Provide short-term aid: The local government and international organizations
  should provide funds and resources to support those in need. This aid should include
  food, water, and other basic necessities to help individuals and families survive
  the current crisis.


  2. Create job opportunities: The local government and international organizations
  should work together to create job opportunities for those who lost their jobs due
  to the drought. These job opportunities should be in sectors that are not affected
  by the drought, such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure.


  3. Invest in sustainable agriculture: The local government and international organizations
  should invest in sustainable agriculture practices that are resilient to future
  natural disasters. This investment should include providing farmers with drought-resistant
  crops and livestock, as well as training them in sustainable agriculture practices.


  4. Develop renewable energy sources: The local government and international organizations
  should invest in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to reduce
  the reliance on fossil fuels. This investment will not only reduce the carbon footprint
  but also provide a reliable source of energy that is not affected by natural disasters.


  5. Conduct research and gather data: The local government and international organizations
  should conduct research and gather data on the factors that contributed to the drought
  and its impact on the local environment and economy. This data will help us understand
  the root cause of the problem and develop measures to prevent future disasters.


  The expected result of these actions is to help these communities recover from the
  current crisis and prevent future crises. By providing short-term aid and creating
  job opportunities, we can help individuals and families survive the current crisis.
  By investing in sustainable agriculture and renewable energy sources, we can help
  these communities be self-sufficient and resilient to future natural disasters.
  By conducting research and gathering data, we can understand the root cause of the
  problem and develop measures to prevent future disasters. Ultimately, these actions
  will reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe.'

original_scenario: The recent drought has determined the fate of many small communities
  in Subsaharan Africa, causing an annoyance to the local economies. This natural
  disaster has hit the region hard, leaving many farmers without crops and livestock.
  Without the ability to produce goods, the economy has taken a major hit. The lack
  of resources has caused many businesses to close and unemployment to skyrocket.
  The local government is struggling to find a solution to this economic crisis and
  provide aid to those in need. The severity of this drought has emphasized the need
  for long-term solutions to ensure the survival of these communities in the future.
