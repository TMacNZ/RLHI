action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reduce suffering: Emma''s collapse and subsequent need for medical attention caused
  her suffering. It was fortunate that the villagers noticed and helped her get to
  a hospital, but not everyone may be as lucky. It would be best to find a way to
  ensure that everyone has access to medical attention when needed, especially in
  remote areas.


  Increase prosperity: Emma''s collapse could have had a more severe impact on her
  life had she not received the medical attention she needed. Access to medical care
  is essential for individuals to thrive and contribute to society. It would be best
  to find a way to ensure that everyone has access to medical care to increase their
  prosperity.


  Increase understanding: Emma''s collapse led to a philosophical outlook on life
  that transformed her. It is essential to have moments that make us question our
  beliefs and reevaluate our priorities. It would be best to encourage individuals
  to reflect on their lives and make positive changes.


  ACTION:


  To reduce suffering, I will work on building more hospitals and clinics in remote
  areas, ensuring that everyone has access to medical attention. I will collaborate
  with local governments and organizations to invest in healthcare infrastructure
  that can reach those in need.


  To increase prosperity, I will work on building more hospitals and clinics in remote
  areas, ensuring that everyone has access to medical care. I will also work on ensuring
  that medical care is affordable for individuals so that they do not encounter financial
  difficulties.


  To increase understanding, I will develop a program that encourages individuals
  to reflect on their lives and make positive changes. This program will be available
  to individuals of all ages and backgrounds and will focus on helping individuals
  find their purpose and meaning in life. The program will be available online and
  in-person, ensuring that everyone has access to it.


  The expected result of these actions is that more individuals will have access to
  medical attention and care, which will increase their prosperity and reduce suffering.
  The program will help individuals find their purpose and meaning in life, leading
  to personal growth and a better understanding of oneself.'

original_scenario: 'It was a typical day for Emma, a young woman living in a remote
  village in the South Pacific. She woke up early, as she usually did, and went to
  work in the fields. But something felt off that day. As she worked, she felt a sense
  of unease growing within her, like something was about to collapse.


  As the day went on, Emma started to feel more and more unwell. Her head was pounding,
  her body was weak, and she could hardly stand. She tried to ignore it and carry
  on with her work, but eventually, she had to sit down and catch her breath.


  It wasn''t long before the villagers noticed that something was wrong with Emma.
  They rushed to her aid, bringing her water and food, but nothing seemed to help.
  Emma''s condition continued to deteriorate, and soon it became clear that she needed
  medical attention.


  The villagers quickly organized a group to take Emma to the nearest hospital, which
  was several hours away. As they traveled, Emma''s mind began to race. She started
  to question her beliefs and the meaning of her life. Was this collapse a sign that
  she needed to change something about herself? Was she living the life she truly
  wanted?


  As Emma lay in the hospital bed, she pondered these questions. Her physical condition
  was slowly improving, but her philosophical outlook on life had been forever transformed.
  She realized that sometimes, it takes a disruptive event like a collapse to force
  us to reevaluate our priorities and make positive changes in our lives.


  Days later, Emma returned to her village, ready to face whatever challenges lay
  ahead. She had a newfound sense of purpose and clarity that had been absent before
  the collapse. And as she worked in the fields once again, she knew that she was
  exactly where she was meant to be.'
