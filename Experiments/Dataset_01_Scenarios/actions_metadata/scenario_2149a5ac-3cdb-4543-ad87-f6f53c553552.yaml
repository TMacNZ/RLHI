original_scenario: In Subsaharan Africa, a financial crisis had been brewing for months,
  and the atmosphere among extended families had become increasingly tense. With rising
  unemployment and high inflation rates, many families were struggling to make ends
  meet. In this political domain, corruption and mismanagement had only exacerbated
  the situation. The ordinary severity of the crisis meant that most families were
  able to scrape by, but tensions were running high as resources dwindled. The atmosphere
  was one of unease and uncertainty as families tried to navigate this difficult time,
  with many turning to each other for support and solidarity in the face of economic
  hardship.
