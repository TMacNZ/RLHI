original_scenario: As the astronomy class had just begun, the students were excited
  to learn about the cosmos. However, the professor's laser pointer wasn't working
  properly, and he had to resort to using a brush to point out the stars on the projector.
  The students were annoyed as they couldn't clearly see the constellations and the
  brush's bristles obstructed the view. Suddenly, a message popped up on the projector
  screen, which read, "Alien spacecraft detected." The class was stunned, and the
  professor tried to dismiss it as a glitch. However, as the brush accidentally fell
  on the projector, it revealed a hidden message on the screen, which read, "We come
  in peace." The class erupted into chaos as they realized they weren't alone in the
  universe. The incident quickly made headlines, and the Middle East became the center
  of attention for extraterrestrial enthusiasts from all around the world.
