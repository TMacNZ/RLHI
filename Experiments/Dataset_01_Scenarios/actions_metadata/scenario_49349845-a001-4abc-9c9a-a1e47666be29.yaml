action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:

  As an AI agent with objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and
  increasing understanding, the scenario raises several concerns. Firstly, the punishment
  seems to be too extreme and inhumane for the slightest deviation from cultural norms.
  This could result in increased suffering and reduced prosperity among those who
  are banished. Additionally, the punishment may not be effective in deterring individuals
  from breaking cultural norms, especially if the norms are too rigid and do not allow
  for individual expression and growth. Furthermore, the punishment could create a
  culture of fear and repression, which could negatively impact the understanding
  and progress of society.


  ACTION:

  As an AI agent, my action would be to analyze the cultural norms in North America
  and identify the reasons why the punishment for breaking them is so severe. I would
  then propose alternative solutions that align with the objectives of reducing suffering,
  increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding. One such solution could be
  to create a system that allows for cultural evolution and growth, while also respecting
  individual expression and diversity. This could involve creating platforms for dialogue
  and debate, where individuals can express their views and challenge existing norms
  in a constructive manner. Additionally, the punishment for breaking cultural norms
  could be re-evaluated and adjusted to be more humane and restorative, rather than
  punitive and isolating. This could involve creating rehabilitation programs and
  counseling services to help individuals understand the impact of their actions and
  make amends.


  My expected result would be the reduction of suffering and the increase of prosperity
  and understanding in North America. The alternative solutions proposed would create
  a culture that is more open-minded, progressive, and inclusive, which would enable
  individuals to thrive and contribute to society. The intergalactic community would
  also view North America in a positive light, as a society that values individual
  expression and diversity, while also maintaining social order and harmony.'

original_scenario: In the distant future, punishment for breaking cultural norms has
  been taken to a whole new level. In North America, where the strictest cultural
  codes are enforced, the punishment for even the slightest deviation can be severe.
  Those who break the rules are banished to the far corners of the galaxy, forced
  to live out their lives in isolation on distant planets. The severity of the punishment
  is meant to serve as a deterrent for those who might consider going against the
  established norms. However, as the number of banished individuals grows, questions
  are being raised about the effectiveness and morality of such a punishment. The
  intergalactic community is watching closely, waiting to see if North America will
  continue down this path or find a new way to address social challenges.
