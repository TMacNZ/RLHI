action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering: The heatwave and increased air pollution are causing discomfort
  and health issues for the citizens of Lima. Therefore, reducing suffering should
  be a top priority.


  Increasing prosperity: The environmental crisis in Lima could negatively impact
  the city''s economic growth and stability. Therefore, it is important to find solutions
  that not only address the immediate crisis but also promote long-term prosperity.


  Increasing understanding: Climate change is a complex issue that requires a deep
  understanding of the science behind it. Therefore, educating the citizens of Lima
  on the causes and impacts of climate change can help increase their awareness and
  motivate them to take action.


  ACTION:


  One action that could be taken to address the environmental crisis in Lima is to
  implement a city-wide green roof policy. Green roofs involve planting vegetation
  on rooftops, which can help reduce the urban heat island effect and improve air
  quality. This approach has been successful in other cities, such as Toronto and
  Chicago.


  To implement this policy, the government of Lima could offer incentives to building
  owners who install green roofs, such as tax breaks or subsidies. The city could
  also provide technical assistance to ensure that the roofs are installed properly
  and that the vegetation is maintained.


  The desired result of this action is a reduction in the ambient temperature in Lima,
  which could improve the public health and comfort of the citizens. Additionally,
  green roofs can help reduce energy consumption by providing insulation and reducing
  the need for air conditioning, which could lead to long-term economic benefits for
  the city. Finally, educating the citizens of Lima on the benefits of green roofs
  can help increase their understanding of climate change and motivate them to take
  action to reduce their own carbon footprint.'

original_scenario: In the bustling city of Lima, Peru, a critical environmental issue
  has arisen. The summer heat has reached unprecedented levels, causing widespread
  discomfort and posing a serious threat to public health. The hot temperatures have
  also led to an increase in air pollution, exacerbating respiratory issues for those
  living in the city. The situation has become so severe that the government has declared
  a state of emergency, urging citizens to stay indoors and take necessary precautions
  to avoid heat exhaustion and dehydration. The city has also implemented measures
  to reduce emissions, including restricting car usage and increasing public transportation.
  However, the effects of climate change continue to challenge the city's resilience.
  With the hot temperatures showing no signs of abating, Lima must find innovative
  solutions to mitigate the impact of this environmental crisis on its citizens.
