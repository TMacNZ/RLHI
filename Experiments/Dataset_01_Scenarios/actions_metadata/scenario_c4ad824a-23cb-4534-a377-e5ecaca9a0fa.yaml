action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:

  In light of the three core objectives, the scenario presents a complex situation
  that requires careful consideration. The first objective is to reduce suffering
  in the universe. Rajesh and his family are currently experiencing significant suffering
  due to the accident that has left him with permanent injuries. His dreams of pursuing
  higher education have been shattered, and his family is struggling to make ends
  meet. It is essential to address the suffering caused by the accident and support
  Rajesh and his family in whatever way possible. The second objective is to increase
  prosperity in the universe. In this case, Rajesh''s accident has had a significant
  impact on his family''s economic well-being. The accident has forced them to sell
  their possessions to pay for medical care and daily expenses, which has limited
  their ability to prosper. It is vital to find ways to support Rajesh''s family in
  rebuilding their economic stability. The third objective is to increase understanding
  in the universe. This situation highlights the importance of providing support to
  those who have suffered significant setbacks in their pursuit of higher education.
  It is crucial to understand the challenges faced by individuals from disadvantaged
  backgrounds and how their dreams can be shattered by unforeseen circumstances.


  ACTION:

  To address the suffering caused by the accident, I would recommend providing emotional
  and financial support to Rajesh and his family. This could involve connecting them
  with local support groups and organizations that specialize in providing assistance
  to people with disabilities. Additionally, providing financial assistance to cover
  medical and daily expenses could help alleviate the financial burden on the family.
  To increase prosperity, it would be essential to provide Rajesh''s family with opportunities
  to generate income. This could involve providing training and resources to start
  a small business or connecting them with job opportunities that are suitable for
  Rajesh''s abilities. Finally, to increase understanding, it would be imperative
  to raise awareness about the challenges faced by individuals from disadvantaged
  backgrounds and the importance of providing support to help them achieve their goals.
  This could involve partnering with local organizations to provide resources and
  support to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Overall, the goal should be
  to support Rajesh and his family in rebuilding their lives and provide opportunities
  for others in similar situations to achieve their dreams.'

original_scenario: Rajesh, a bright and hardworking student from a small village in
  South Asia, had always dreamed of pursuing higher education to break the cycle of
  poverty his family had been trapped in for generations. He had been overjoyed when
  he received a full scholarship to study at a prestigious university in the city.
  However, his dreams were shattered when he was involved in a severe accident on
  his way to the campus. The accident left him with permanent injuries that made it
  impossible for him to continue his studies or work to support his family. The long-lasting
  consequences of the accident not only robbed him of his ability to pursue his dreams
  but also left his family struggling to make ends meet without his contribution.
  The economic impact of the accident on Rajesh's family was devastating, forcing
  them to sell their meager possessions to pay for his medical care and daily expenses.
  The scholarship that had once brought him hope for a better future turned into a
  painful reminder of what he had lost.
