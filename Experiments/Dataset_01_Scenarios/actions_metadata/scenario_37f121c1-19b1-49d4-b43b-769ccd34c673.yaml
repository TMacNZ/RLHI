original_scenario: 'Captain Sarah Smith had just finished her shift on the interstellar
  ship when she received an urgent message from the Pacific region. It was a distress
  call from a wealthy business tycoon who had been stranded on a remote planet after
  his spaceship malfunctioned. The man, who was known for his lavish lifestyle and
  extravagant spending, had been left with nothing but the clothes on his back, as
  his luggage had been lost in transit.


  As Sarah landed on the planet and made her way towards the tycoon''s location, she
  couldn''t help but feel annoyed at the situation. She had dealt with her fair share
  of financial crises during her time in the legal domain and knew how difficult they
  could be to resolve. However, this time the issue seemed somewhat trivial - a naked
  man stuck on a planet with no possessions.


  Upon reaching the tycoon''s location, Sarah found him sitting on a rock, shivering
  and looking completely miserable. She quickly assessed the situation and began making
  arrangements to get him off the planet. However, as she worked on the logistics,
  the tycoon began to reveal just how dire his financial situation was. He had been
  on the brink of bankruptcy and had been using his last remaining funds to invest
  in a new venture that he believed would save him from ruin.


  As Sarah listened to his story, she began to realize just how serious the situation
  was. If the tycoon''s venture failed, it could trigger a financial crisis that would
  have ripple effects throughout the entire interstellar economy. She knew that she
  had to act quickly to help him get back on track.


  In the end, Sarah was able to secure a loan for the tycoon from a group of investors
  who believed in his vision. With the funds, he was able to get his venture off the
  ground and turn his financial situation around. As she watched him leave the planet,
  fully clothed and with a renewed sense of hope, Sarah couldn''t help but feel grateful
  that she had been able to help. Though it had seemed like a minor annoyance at first,
  the situation had turned out to be much more serious than she had initially anticipated.'
