original_scenario: 'In the vast expanse of the universe, there existed a tiny planet
  known as Earth. On this planet, in a small village in North Africa, lived a young
  man named Ahmed. Ahmed was a curious individual who had always been fascinated by
  the concept of lifetime. He often wondered why some people lived longer than others,
  and what determined the duration of one''s life.


  One day, while sitting under a tree, Ahmed decided to delve deeper into this intellectual
  question. He started researching various theories and beliefs about the concept
  of lifetime. He discovered that some people believed that the length of one''s life
  was predetermined at birth, while others believed that it was influenced by one''s
  actions and environment.


  As Ahmed continued his research, he stumbled upon a book that spoke of the cosmic
  energy that governed the lifetime of all living beings. According to the book, every
  living being had a specific amount of cosmic energy that determined the length of
  their life. The energy could be replenished through certain practices, such as meditation
  and yoga, which could potentially extend one''s lifetime.


  Ahmed was intrigued by this theory and decided to incorporate these practices in
  his daily routine. He spent hours meditating under the same tree where he had started
  his research. He practiced yoga and sought to live a healthy lifestyle. Over time,
  he noticed a significant change in his physical and mental well-being.


  Years passed, and Ahmed grew old. However, he had lived a long and fulfilling life,
  much longer than any of his peers in the village. His dedication to understanding
  the concept of lifetime had paid off, and he was content with the time he had been
  given.


  As Ahmed took his last breath, he realized that the concept of lifetime was not
  just a mundane issue but rather a universal truth that governed all living beings.
  He had found his purpose in life, and his legacy would live on through the lessons
  he had shared with others.'
