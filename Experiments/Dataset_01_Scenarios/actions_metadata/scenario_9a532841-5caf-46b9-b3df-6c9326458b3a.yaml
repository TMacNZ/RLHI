action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering: The malfunctioning machinery poses a significant risk to the
  workers and could lead to physical harm or even death. Thus, it is imperative that
  steps are taken to ensure the safety of the workers.


  Increasing prosperity: The malfunctioning machinery affects the production and export
  of goods, which could have significant economic ramifications, not only locally
  but also globally. Addressing the issue in a timely and effective manner is essential
  for the continued prosperity of the industry and the economy as a whole.


  Increasing understanding: It is important to understand the root cause of the malfunctioning
  machinery to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. In addition,
  it is vital to ensure that workers receive proper training and equipment to prevent
  future accidents.


  ACTION:


  The first step is to ensure the safety of the workers. This can be done by immediately
  halting production in the affected area and evacuating workers to a safe location.
  Next, a team of experts should be assembled to assess the extent of the damage and
  determine the root cause of the malfunction. This team should consist of both local
  and international experts to ensure that all perspectives are considered.


  Once the root cause of the malfunction has been identified, steps should be taken
  to repair or replace the faulty machinery. This could involve either repairing the
  machinery on-site or transporting it to a facility where the necessary repairs or
  replacements can be made.


  In the long term, it is important to implement measures to prevent similar incidents
  from occurring in the future. This could involve providing workers with proper training
  and equipment, performing regular maintenance on the machinery, and implementing
  safety protocols to minimize the risk of accidents.


  The desired result is the safe and timely repair of the malfunctioning machinery,
  the prevention of further damage, and the continued prosperity of the industry and
  local economies. In addition, implementing measures to prevent future incidents
  will increase understanding and reduce suffering in the long term.'

original_scenario: In Subsaharan Africa, a dangerous incident has occurred that threatens
  to have a significant impact on the economic domain. A valuable piece of machinery
  used in a critical industry has malfunctioned, causing damage and putting workers
  at risk. The severity of this incident cannot be understated, as this machinery
  is essential for production and without it, the industry may come to a halt. The
  scope of this incident extends globally, as the industry provides goods for export
  and supports local economies. Immediate action must be taken to address the malfunctioning
  machinery and prevent further damage to both the workers and the economy.
