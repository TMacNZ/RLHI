  institutions to identify any ongoing projects or research that the individual was
  involved in and provide support to ensure that the work is continued. This may include
  providing funding or resources to the research team or identifying other individuals
  who can continue the work.


  To increase understanding and prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future,
  I will work with local and national organizations to raise awareness about road
  safety. This may include organizing awareness campaigns or working with policymakers
  to implement stricter regulations and enforcement around safe driving practices.
