  \ way to address the ethical dilemma. The addition of the small square with the\
  \ words \"Intellectual Property Matters\" was a subtle yet powerful way to convey\

original_scenario: 'In a small neighborhood within South America, there was a heated
  ethical dilemma brewing. A local artist had been commissioned to create a mural
  on the side of a building, and the contract that had been signed stipulated that
  the mural would feature the faces of prominent community members.


  However, as the artist began sketching out the design, she realized that one of
  the community members included in the contract was a known intellectual property
  thief. The artist was torn between fulfilling the contract and potentially endorsing
  unethical behavior, or breaking the contract and facing legal consequences.


  As word of the situation spread throughout the neighborhood, tensions rose. Some
  community members argued that the artist should simply paint over the offending
  face, while others insisted that the contract must be upheld in its entirety.


  The artist herself was torn between her artistic integrity and her obligation to
  the contract. She knew that painting the intellectual property thief''s face would
  compromise her own values, but she also didn''t want to disappoint the community
  members who had commissioned her work.


  Ultimately, after much deliberation and discussion with legal experts, the artist
  decided to paint the mural as contracted, but with a subtle addition. In the corner
  of the mural, she painted a small square with the words "Intellectual Property Matters"
  in bold letters, a nod to the ethical dilemma she had faced.


  The mural was completed and unveiled to the community, and while some were disappointed
  that the intellectual property thief''s face was included, most appreciated the
  artist''s solution and the reminder of the importance of ethics in the community.
  The mural became a symbol of the community''s values, and the artist was applauded
  for her thoughtful approach to an otherwise annoying situation.'
