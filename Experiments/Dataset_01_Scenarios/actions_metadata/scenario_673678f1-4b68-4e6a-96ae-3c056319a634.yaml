original_scenario: The intergalactic veteran had seen it all. With decades of experience
  fighting in wars across the universe, she thought she had witnessed the worst of
  humanity. But as she landed in North Africa, she quickly realized that the political
  unrest in this region was unlike anything she had ever encountered. The disruptive
  protests and violent clashes between rival factions were tearing the region apart,
  and the veteran couldn't help but feel a sense of despair. As she walked the streets,
  she found herself contemplating the nature of human conflict and the seemingly endless
  cycle of violence that plagued so many civilizations. Despite her years of service,
  she couldn't help but wonder if there was a solution to the philosophical questions
  that lingered at the heart of all this unrest.
