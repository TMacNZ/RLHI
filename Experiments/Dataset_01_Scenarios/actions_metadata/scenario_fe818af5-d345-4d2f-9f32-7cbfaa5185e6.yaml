action: "CONSIDERATIONS: \n\nReduce Suffering: \n\nThe situation of the nuclear family\
  \ is a clear example of suffering. The lack of electricity restricts their ability\
  \ to perform daily tasks, which, in turn, causes physical and mental distress to\
  \ the family members. The use of kerosene lamps and open fires poses a safety risk\
  \ and health issues, and the lack of access to education has long-term implications.\
  \ Therefore, it is important to take action to reduce their suffering.\n\nIncrease\
  \ Prosperity: \n\nThe lack of technology has not only hindered the daily lives of\
  \ the family but also has long-term consequences for their future opportunities.\
  \ The children are unable to study after dark, falling behind in their education,\
  \ which can limit their potential in the future. The father, unable to complete\
  \ his work, may suffer income loss, putting the family's financial stability at\
  \ risk. Therefore, it is important to take action to increase their prosperity.\n\
  \nIncrease Understanding: \n\nTo address the issue, we need to understand the root\
  \ cause of the technological failure. It could be due to lack of access to technology\
  \ or financial constraints. It is important to gather information to develop a solution\
  \ that could help the family, as well as other families facing the same issue in\
  \ the region. \n\nACTION: \n\nTo reduce the family's suffering and increase their\
  \ prosperity, I will take the following action:\n\n1. Conduct a Needs Assessment:\
  \ \n\nThe first step is to conduct a needs assessment to understand the root cause\
  \ of the technological failure. This will involve gathering information about the\
  \ family's access to technology, their financial situation, and other factors that\
  \ may have contributed to the issue.\n\n2. Provide Solar Panels: \n\nBased on the\
  \ needs assessment, I will provide solar panels to the family. Solar panels are\
  \ a reliable source of energy that can be used to power lights, charge phones, and\
  \ other devices. This will enable the family to study after dark, cook food safely,\
  \ and improve their overall quality of life. \n\n3. Educate the Family on Solar\
  \ Panel Maintenance: \n\nIt is also important to educate the family on solar panel\
  \ maintenance to ensure that they are able to use the panels effectively and efficiently.\
  \ This will involve providing information on how to clean and maintain the panels,\
  \ as well as how to troubleshoot common issues.\n\n4. Monitor the Family's Progress:\
  \ \n\nTo ensure that the family is benefiting from the solar panels, I will monitor\
  \ their progress regularly. This will involve conducting follow-up visits to the\
  \ family's home to ensure that the panels are working properly and to address any\
  \ issues that may arise.\n\nExpected Result: \n\nThe provision of solar panels to\
  \ the family will reduce their suffering and increase their prosperity. The family\
  \ will be able to perform daily tasks safely and efficiently, and the children will\
  \ have the opportunity to study after dark, improving their education and future\
  \ opportunities. The use of solar panels will also have long-term benefits for the\
  \ family's financial stability, as they will no longer have to rely on expensive\
  \ and unreliable sources of energy."

original_scenario: In rural Subsaharan Africa, a nuclear family was burdened with
  a technological failure that left them without power for weeks. With no access to
  electricity, the family struggled to complete everyday tasks like cooking, cleaning,
  and studying. The father had to resort to using a kerosene lamp to finish his work
  for the day, while the mother had to cook on an open fire, causing respiratory issues
  for the family. The children were unable to study after dark, falling behind in
  their education. Despite their efforts to fix the issue, the family was unable to
  afford the necessary repairs, leaving them in the dark for an indefinite period
  of time. The lack of technology not only hindered their daily lives but also had
  long-term consequences for their future opportunities.
