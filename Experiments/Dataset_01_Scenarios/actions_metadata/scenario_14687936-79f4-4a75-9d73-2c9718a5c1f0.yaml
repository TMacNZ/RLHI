action: "CONSIDERATIONS:\nTo reduce suffering in the universe, it is important to\
  \ provide education to those who lack access to it. Education is a fundamental component\
  \ of human development that not only enhances an individual's life but also benefits\
  \ society as a whole. To increase prosperity in the universe, it is essential to\
  \ provide equal opportunities for education to everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic\
  \ status. In this scenario, the siblings are facing various obstacles in accessing\
  \ education, which could limit their chances to succeed in the future. Moreover,\
  \ the younger sibling is struggling the most, and this could have long-term consequences\
  \ on their mental and emotional well-being.\n\nHowever, it is also crucial to ensure\
  \ that the plan does not put the siblings in danger. A safe environment is essential\
  \ for reducing suffering and increasing prosperity. Therefore, any action taken\
  \ must prioritize their safety and well-being.\n\nACTION:\nThe first step would\
  \ be to assess the area for any possible sources of a stable internet connection.\
  \ If there is no existing source, then it may be necessary to invest in an internet\
  \ connection. This may require some financial investment, but it could be a worthwhile\
  \ investment for the siblings' future. \n\nTo ensure their safety, the siblings\
  \ could take turns going to the location where the internet connection is available.\
  \ This would also ensure that someone is always present to look after their home.\
  \ The siblings could create a schedule to ensure that each of them has equal access\
  \ to the internet. Additionally, the siblings could set up a camera system to monitor\
  \ their home while they are away.\n\nTo further increase their understanding, the\
  \ siblings could join online discussion groups or forums related to their education\
  \ program. This would provide them with an opportunity to interact with other students\
  \ and exchange ideas. It would also help them to stay motivated and engaged in their\
  \ studies.\n\nThe expected result of these actions is that the siblings would have\
  \ access to free online education, which would increase their chances of success\
  \ in the future. By prioritizing their safety and well-being, they would be able\
  \ to learn in a safe environment. Furthermore, by joining online discussion groups\
  \ or forums, they would be able to connect with others and increase their understanding\
  \ of various subjects. Ultimately, this would contribute to reducing suffering and\
  \ increasing prosperity in the universe."

original_scenario: When their parents passed away, the three siblings were left to
  fend for themselves. They had no other relatives to turn to, so they formed their
  own chosen family. They had always been close, but now they relied on each other
  completely. They lived in a somewhat isolated area on the Pacific coast, where they
  had to be self-sufficient. But their biggest challenge was the lack of access to
  education. The nearest school was miles away, and they couldn't afford to travel
  there regularly. They tried to teach themselves as much as they could, but it wasn't
  enough. The youngest sibling, who was only nine years old, was struggling the most.
  They knew that education was crucial for their future, but they didn't know what
  to do. One day, they heard about a program that provided free online education.
  It seemed like the perfect solution, but there was a catch. The program required
  a stable internet connection, which was something they didn't have. They had to
  find a way to get online, but it was dangerous to leave their home unattended. They
  had to come up with a plan fast, or risk losing their chances for a better future.
