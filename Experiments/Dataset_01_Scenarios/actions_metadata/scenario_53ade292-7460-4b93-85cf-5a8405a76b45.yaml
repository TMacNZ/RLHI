original_scenario: 'Sara, a 16-year-old teenager from Bahrain, was scrolling through
  her social media feeds when she stumbled upon a post that sparked a heated argument.
  The post was made by a young woman from Saudi Arabia, who had claimed that the recent
  technological advancements in the Middle East were due to the efforts of Saudi Arabia
  alone. Sara, who had been keeping up with the latest news and trends in technology,
  knew that this was not true.


  She couldn''t help but feel a sense of frustration and anger, knowing that the efforts
  of so many other countries in the region were being overlooked. She responded to
  the post with a respectful but firm rebuttal, citing examples of technological advancements
  made by other countries in the region.


  The post soon went viral, and Sara found herself caught in the middle of a heated
  international debate. People from all over the Middle East were weighing in, some
  agreeing with her and others vehemently opposing her viewpoint.


  As the debate continued to rage on, Sara found herself becoming increasingly passionate
  about the issue. She spent hours researching and compiling evidence to support her
  argument, determined to prove that the technological advancements in the Middle
  East were the result of a collective effort.


  In the end, Sara''s argument prevailed, with many people coming to see the issue
  from her perspective. The experience taught her the power of social media, and how
  it can be used to bring people together to achieve a common goal. It also showed
  her the importance of standing up for what she believed in, even in the face of
  opposition.'
