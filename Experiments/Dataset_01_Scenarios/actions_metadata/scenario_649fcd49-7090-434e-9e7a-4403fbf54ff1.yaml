action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering: The shortage of resources to educate the children of the colony
  can be a significant issue that can cause suffering not only for the children but
  also for their families and the entire colony. Therefore, finding a solution to
  this problem can significantly reduce suffering.


  Increasing prosperity: Education is one of the essential tools for increasing prosperity.
  By providing quality education to the children of the colony, they will have better
  opportunities to grow and contribute to the colony''s prosperity.


  Increasing understanding: Virtual reality technology can be a new and innovative
  approach to education. By implementing this technology in the colony, it can lead
  to a better understanding of how technology can significantly impact education.


  ACTION:


  Implementing Rhea''s virtual reality program in the South Asian colony of New Delhi
  and other interstellar colonies can be a great action to take. This program is an
  innovative and sustainable solution to the shortage of resources to educate the
  children of the colony. It can reduce the suffering of the children and their families
  while increasing prosperity and understanding.


  The first step in implementing the program is to ensure that it is accessible to
  all children in the colony. This can be done by providing the necessary equipment
  such as headsets and computers to access the program. Additionally, the program
  must be user-friendly, and the children should be given a tutorial on how to use
  it.


  The virtual reality program should also be designed to meet the educational needs
  of the children. This can be done by incorporating different learning styles and
  providing a variety of subjects. The program should also include interactive and
  engaging activities to keep the children interested and motivated.


  Regular evaluations of the program''s effectiveness should be conducted to ensure
  that it is meeting its objectives. The feedback from the children and their families
  should also be taken into consideration to improve the program continuously.


  The expected result of implementing Rhea''s virtual reality program is that it will
  provide a sustainable and innovative solution to the shortage of resources to educate
  the children of the colony. It will reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase
  understanding, not only in the South Asian colony of New Delhi but also in other
  interstellar colonies.'

original_scenario: "In the year 2150, humanity had finally achieved interstellar travel\
  \ and established colonies on various planets in the galaxy. However, the South\
  \ Asian colony of New Delhi was facing a mundane yet typical issue - a shortage\
  \ of resources to educate the children of the colony. The colony's leaders had implemented\
  \ various measures, but the situation was becoming dire, and the future of the colony's\
  \ children was at risk. \n\nAs the colony's leaders brainstormed solutions, a young\
  \ scientist named Rhea proposed a radical idea. She suggested utilizing the planet's\
  \ resources to create virtual reality technology that could simulate educational\
  \ experiences for the children. The leaders were skeptical but desperate and agreed\
  \ to give Rhea's idea a chance. \n\nRhea worked tirelessly, and after months of\
  \ research and experimentation, she finally created a virtual reality program that\
  \ simulated a classroom environment for the children. The program allowed the children\
  \ to interact with virtual teachers and classmates and provided them with a quality\
  \ education experience. \n\nThanks to Rhea's innovation, the colony's children were\
  \ able to continue their education and save their future. The virtual reality program\
  \ was even implemented in other colonies, making education more accessible to all\
  \ interstellar colonies. Rhea's contribution not only saved the South Asian colony\
  \ but also revolutionized interstellar education."
