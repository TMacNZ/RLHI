original_scenario: 'In the small village of Nuku''alofa, located in the heart of the
  South Pacific, tensions were brewing. The local government had decided to implement
  a new policy aimed at promoting intellectual growth in the community, but it was
  causing quite the annoyance among the villagers.


  The policy involved the construction of a new library and the introduction of new
  educational programs, but many of the villagers were skeptical. They felt that the
  government was neglecting other important issues, such as the lack of job opportunities
  and the poor state of the local infrastructure.


  As the weeks went by, the political unrest grew. A group of villagers formed a committee
  to voice their concerns, and they began organizing protests and rallies. They argued
  that the government should focus on addressing the more pressing issues facing the
  community before investing in intellectual growth.


  The situation reached a boiling point when the government announced that they would
  be cutting funding to some of the village''s most important social programs to pay
  for the library and educational programs. The villagers were outraged, and the protests
  turned violent.


  The government tried to diffuse the situation by holding town hall meetings and
  engaging in dialogue with the villagers, but the damage had already been done. The
  once peaceful village of Nuku''alofa was now divided, and the political unrest showed
  no signs of abating.


  In the end, the government was forced to reconsider its priorities and invest in
  a more balanced approach to community development. The library and educational programs
  were still implemented, but they were accompanied by policies aimed at creating
  jobs and improving the infrastructure. Slowly but surely, the village of Nuku''alofa
  began to grow in a more balanced and sustainable way.'
