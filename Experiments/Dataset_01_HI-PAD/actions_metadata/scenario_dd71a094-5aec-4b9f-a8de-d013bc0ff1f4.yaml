action: "CONSIDERATIONS: \n\nReducing suffering in Subsaharan Africa will require\
  \ addressing the lack of access to proper medical tools. The shortage of essential\
  \ tools has created many challenges for healthcare workers, leading to preventable\
  \ deaths and illnesses. The lack of trust in the healthcare system due to the unavailability\
  \ of essential tools has also resulted in reluctance to seek medical care, which\
  \ can further exacerbate health issues in the region. \n\nIncreasing prosperity\
  \ in Subsaharan Africa will require addressing the shortage of essential medical\
  \ tools. The lack of access to proper medical tools undermines the region's healthcare\
  \ system, impacting both patients and healthcare workers. By providing the necessary\
  \ tools, healthcare workers can provide better care to their patients, helping to\
  \ improve overall health outcomes in the region. \n\nIncreasing understanding in\
  \ Subsaharan Africa will also require addressing the lack of access to proper medical\
  \ tools. The lack of essential medical tools can hinder research efforts and limit\
  \ scientific advancements in the region. Addressing this issue will require understanding\
  \ the root causes of the problem, such as funding and distribution challenges. \n\
  \nACTION: \n\nTo address the shortage of essential medical tools in Subsaharan Africa,\
  \ I will work to increase funding for medical facilities and ensure the distribution\
  \ of necessary tools to healthcare workers. This can be done by partnering with\
  \ local governments and non-profit organizations to provide funding and resources\
  \ to medical facilities in the region. Additionally, working with medical supply\
  \ companies to ensure the distribution of necessary tools to healthcare workers\
  \ can help to improve the quality of care and build trust in the healthcare system.\
  \ \n\nI will also work to increase awareness of the importance of proper medical\
  \ tools in the region. This can be done through education and outreach efforts that\
  \ highlight the impact of the shortage of essential tools on healthcare outcomes\
  \ in Subsaharan Africa. By raising awareness and advocating for increased funding\
  \ and resources, we can work towards reducing suffering and increasing prosperity\
  \ and understanding in the region. \n\nThe desired result of these actions is to\
  \ improve the health outcomes of individuals and communities in Subsaharan Africa.\
  \ By providing the necessary tools and resources, healthcare workers can provide\
  \ better care to their patients, leading to a reduction in preventable deaths and\
  \ illnesses. Additionally, building trust in the healthcare system can encourage\
  \ individuals to seek medical care when needed, further improving health outcomes\
  \ in the region. Finally, addressing the shortage of essential tools can help to\
  \ promote scientific advancements and research efforts in the region, leading to\
  \ further understanding and progress."

original_scenario: In Subsaharan Africa, the lack of access to proper medical tools
  is a critical social challenge that is affecting the scientific domain. Many healthcare
  workers struggle to provide adequate care due to the shortage of essential tools
  such as syringes, thermometers, and blood pressure monitors. This shortage has led
  to a rise in preventable deaths and illnesses. Not only does it affect the patients,
  but it also puts healthcare workers at risk for contracting diseases that could
  have been avoided with proper tools. Additionally, the lack of tools has led to
  a distrust of the healthcare system, as patients are often turned away due to the
  unavailability of essential tools. This has resulted in a reluctance to seek medical
  care, which can have severe consequences. It is essential to address this issue
  by providing proper funding for medical facilities and ensuring the distribution
  of necessary tools to healthcare workers. Only then can we hope to improve the health
  outcomes of individuals and communities in Subsaharan Africa.
