action: "CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nAs an AI agent with the objective of reducing suffering,\
  \ increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, the scenario\
  \ presents several considerations. First, it is essential to acknowledge the significance\
  \ of personal safety and the need to prioritize it. Second, it is crucial to understand\
  \ that technology can be a source of disagreement and that such disagreements can\
  \ quickly escalate into conflicts that have dire consequences. Third, it is important\
  \ to recognize that technology can be both a boon and a bane, and that its benefits\
  \ and drawbacks need to be examined thoroughly.\n\nACTION:\n\nTo address the scenario's\
  \ issues, I will develop an AI-based solution that will minimize the risks associated\
  \ with the use of a passcode on mobile devices. The solution will involve the creation\
  \ of an application that will enable users to access emergency contacts and medical\
  \ information without the need to enter a passcode. The application will be integrated\
  \ into the phone's operating system and will be activated by voice recognition or\
  \ facial recognition. \n\nThe application will allow users to input emergency contact\
  \ information and medical records without the need for a passcode. In case of an\
  \ emergency, a user will only need to say a predetermined word or phrase, and the\
  \ application will open, displaying the user's emergency contact information and\
  \ medical records. The application will also be able to send the user's location\
  \ to emergency services in case of an emergency.\n\nThe expected result of this\
  \ action is that it will reduce the risk of losing vital information due to the\
  \ use of a passcode on mobile devices. It will also reduce the risk of fatalities\
  \ resulting from technological disagreements by providing users with an alternative\
  \ means of accessing emergency contacts and medical information. Furthermore, the\
  \ application will increase understanding of the benefits of technology by demonstrating\
  \ how it can be used to improve personal safety."

original_scenario: One day, in a bustling city of Asia, a group of friends got into
  a heated argument about the use of a passcode to access their mobile phones. One
  of the friends insisted that it was crucial to have a passcode to protect important
  personal information on the phone. However, another friend disagreed and argued
  that it was unnecessary and a waste of time to enter a passcode every time they
  wanted to use their phone. The disagreement escalated quickly, and before long,
  the group was divided into two factions. Suddenly, one of the friends collapsed
  on the ground, gasping for breath. It turned out that the friend who opposed the
  use of a passcode had a severe allergic reaction and needed immediate medical attention.
  Unfortunately, the passcode on their phone prevented anyone from accessing their
  emergency contacts or medical information. Frantic and panicking, the group realized
  that their argument over the passcode had cost their friend's life. They learned
  a hard lesson that day about the importance of personal safety and the consequences
  of allowing technological disagreements to spiral out of control.
