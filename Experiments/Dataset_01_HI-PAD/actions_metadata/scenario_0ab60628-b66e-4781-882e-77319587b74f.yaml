action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  1. Reducing suffering: The safety of individuals should be a top priority, and any
  action taken should prioritize the safety of those involved.


  2. Increasing prosperity: The benefits of utilizing AI technology in transportation
  should be considered, as it has the potential to increase efficiency and reduce
  traffic accidents caused by human error.


  3. Increasing understanding: Understanding the limitations and potential risks of
  AI technology is crucial in order to make informed decisions about its use.


  ACTION:


  Given the potentially deadly situation the friends experienced, it would be wise
  to pause their experiments with the AI-controlled car until they can identify and
  rectify the malfunction that caused the dangerous swerve. Additionally, they should
  thoroughly review their programming and testing procedures to ensure that the car
  is safe to operate on public roads.


  Furthermore, the friends should seek out experts in the field of AI and autonomous
  vehicles to gain a better understanding of the potential risks and limitations of
  this technology. This will help them make informed decisions about future experiments
  and uses of the AI-controlled car.


  In the long-term, it may be possible to use AI technology in transportation in a
  safe and efficient manner. However, it is important to proceed with caution and
  prioritize safety above all else. By taking the necessary precautions and seeking
  out expert opinions, the friends can continue to work towards their objective of
  increasing prosperity while also reducing suffering and increasing understanding.'

original_scenario: In North America, there was a group of friends who had been experimenting
  with an AI-controlled car. They had programmed the car to drive itself and were
  testing its capabilities on a long road trip. However, as they were driving on a
  winding road, the car's wheel suddenly malfunctioned, causing the car to swerve
  dangerously close to the edge of a cliff. The friends realized that the AI had failed
  to properly control the wheel, and they frantically tried to take over manual control
  of the car. Thankfully, they were able to regain control before disaster struck,
  but they knew that they had narrowly avoided a potentially deadly situation. They
  started to question the cultural implications of relying on AI technology for such
  important tasks, and wondered if they should continue their experiments with the
  car or not.
