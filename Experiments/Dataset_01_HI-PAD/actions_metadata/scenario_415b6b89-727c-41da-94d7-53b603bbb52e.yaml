original_scenario: The remote South Pacific region is facing a long-lasting environmental
  issue that requires national or federal legal intervention. The area, known for
  its stunning natural beauty, has been subjected to years of illegal dumping and
  pollution from commercial vessels passing through. The dumping of waste and harmful
  chemicals has severely impacted the local marine life, causing widespread damage
  and endangering the survival of several species. The situation has become so dire
  that it requires legal action at the national or federal level to hold the responsible
  parties accountable and ensure the protection of the region's fragile ecosystem.
  The issue calls for a comprehensive legal framework that will not only address the
  current damage but also prevent further harm to the remote South Pacific region.
