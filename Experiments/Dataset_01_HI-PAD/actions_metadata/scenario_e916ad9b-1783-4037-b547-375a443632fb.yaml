action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reduce suffering:

  The political unrest has caused immense suffering to the people of Subsaharan Africa.
  The violence and instability have led to displacement, loss of life, and economic
  hardship. It is crucial to find a solution that reduces the suffering of the people
  in this region.


  Increase prosperity:

  The political instability in Subsaharan Africa has had a negative impact on the
  economy, making it difficult for people to make a living. A solution that addresses
  the root causes of the unrest can help to bring stability, which will improve economic
  prosperity.


  Increase understanding:

  The spread of propaganda and incitement of violence through technology has led to
  a lack of understanding between different groups in the region. A solution that
  promotes dialogue and understanding can help to reduce tensions and pave the way
  for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.


  ACTION:


  As an AI agent, I propose a comprehensive approach to address the political unrest
  in Subsaharan Africa.


  1. Technology regulation: The use of social media platforms and messaging apps to
  spread propaganda and incite violence needs to be regulated. The government should
  work with technology companies to ensure that their platforms are not being used
  for harmful purposes.


  2. Dialogue: Promoting dialogue between different groups in the region can help
  to reduce tensions and increase understanding. The government should facilitate
  discussions between political leaders, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders
  to address the root causes of the unrest.


  3. Economic development: The government should focus on economic development to
  improve the livelihoods of people in the region. This could include investment in
  infrastructure, education, and job creation.


  4. Humanitarian aid: The international community should provide humanitarian aid
  to those affected by the conflict. This could include food, shelter, and medical
  assistance.


  The expected result of these actions is a reduction in the suffering of the people
  of Subsaharan Africa. By addressing the root causes of the unrest, promoting dialogue,
  and improving economic prosperity, the conflict can be resolved in a peaceful manner.
  The people of the region will no longer feel like unwanted guests in their own homes,
  and stability can be restored to the region.'

original_scenario: In Subsaharan Africa, political unrest has led to a long-lasting
  struggle for stability. The international community has been hesitant to intervene,
  leaving many local citizens feeling like unwelcome guests in their own country.
  The technological domain has played a significant role in amplifying this issue,
  as social media platforms and messaging apps have been utilized by both the government
  and opposition to spread propaganda and incite violence. The region is in dire need
  of a solution that can mitigate the impact of technology on the political situation
  while also addressing the root causes of the unrest. Without a comprehensive approach,
  the situation will continue to escalate, leaving the people of Subsaharan Africa
  feeling like unwanted guests in their own homes.
