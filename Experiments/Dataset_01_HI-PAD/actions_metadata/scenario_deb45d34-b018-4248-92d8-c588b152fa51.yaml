action: "CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nObjective 1: Reduce suffering in the universe\nThe economic\
  \ conflict between two Eurasian countries has caused frustration and anger among\
  \ the citizens of the affected country due to their businesses suffering, and their\
  \ economy weakening. Therefore, reducing the suffering of the citizens of both countries\
  \ is essential.\n\nObjective 2: Increase prosperity in the universe\nThe imposition\
  \ of heavy tariffs on imports from one country to the other has negatively impacted\
  \ the economies of both countries. Thus, finding a solution that benefits both parties\
  \ and increases prosperity in the universe is necessary.\n\nObjective 3: Increase\
  \ understanding in the universe\nThe conflict between the two countries can be traced\
  \ back to a lack of understanding, which caused the imposition of heavy tariffs.\
  \ Therefore, increasing understanding between the two countries is important to\
  \ prevent similar conflicts in the future.\n\nACTION:\n\nTo achieve the objectives,\
  \ I would recommend the following action - \n\nThe federal government's intervention\
  \ to send a team of expert economists and negotiators to the region to assess the\
  \ situation and begin talks with both countries is a step in the right direction.\
  \ I would suggest continuing these talks and mediations to ensure that both countries'\
  \ economic interests are taken into account in the resolution. \n\nThe gradual reduction\
  \ of tariffs and increased trade between the two countries is a practical solution.\
  \ However, to ensure that this agreement is long-lasting, I would recommend establishing\
  \ a monitoring mechanism to ensure that both countries abide by the agreement. \n\
  \nMoreover, I would recommend promoting cultural exchange programs, educational\
  \ exchange programs, and people-to-people exchange programs between the two countries.\
  \ This will help to increase understanding and cultural appreciation between the\
  \ two countries. \n\nFinally, I would suggest that the federal government invests\
  \ in the development of the affected country's economy to help it recover and become\
  \ more prosperous. This will help to reduce suffering in the universe and support\
  \ the affected country's businesses. \n\nThe expected result of these actions is\
  \ a stable and prosperous economic relationship between the two countries, which\
  \ will reduce suffering in the universe and increase prosperity. Additionally, cultural\
  \ exchange programs and educational exchange programs will increase understanding\
  \ between the two countries, which will help to prevent similar conflicts in the\
  \ future."

original_scenario: The economic conflict between two Eurasian countries had been brewing
  for months, but it finally reached a boiling point when one country imposed heavy
  tariffs on imports from the other. This move caused frustration and anger among
  the citizens of the affected country, who saw their businesses suffer and their
  economy weaken. In response, the national government requested assistance from the
  federal government to help mediate the dispute and find a resolution that would
  benefit both parties. The federal government sent a team of expert economists and
  negotiators to the region to assess the situation and begin talks with both countries.
  After weeks of intense negotiations and compromise, a solution was reached that
  involved a gradual reduction in tariffs and increased trade between the two countries.
  While the annoyance caused by the conflict lingered, the people of both countries
  were relieved to see progress towards a more stable and prosperous economic relationship.
