original_scenario: In the year 2050, the Intergalactic Golf Championship was being
  held in Asia. The top golfers from all corners of the galaxy had gathered to compete
  for the prestigious title. The atmosphere was electric as the golfers prepared to
  tee off. However, during the final round, an incident occurred that left everyone
  in shock. One of the players, a renowned golfer from Planet X, accidentally hit
  the ball into the crowd, hitting a young boy in the process. The boy was rushed
  to the hospital, and fortunately, he only suffered minor injuries. However, the
  incident left the golfer devastated and emotionally distressed. He had always prided
  himself on his precision and accuracy, but this one mistake had caused harm to an
  innocent bystander. The golfer withdrew from the tournament and returned to his
  planet, vowing to never play golf again. The incident served as a reminder that
  accidents can happen, even in the most skilled and precise of sports. It emphasized
  the importance of safety and concentration, and how one small mistake can have a
  significant impact on the lives of others.
