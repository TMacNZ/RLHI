original_scenario: My girlfriend and I were on a trip to the Pacific region when an
  ordinary incident occurred. We were having a deep intellectual conversation about
  our future plans when suddenly, she slipped and fell down the stairs. I rushed to
  help her, but she seemed to have hit her head pretty hard. I was worried and called
  for medical assistance. The paramedics arrived quickly, and they advised us to visit
  the hospital for a thorough checkup. I accompanied her to the hospital, where the
  doctors diagnosed her with a minor concussion. Thankfully, she recovered quickly,
  and we were able to continue our trip. Despite the accident, we still had a great
  time and grew even closer during our adventure.
