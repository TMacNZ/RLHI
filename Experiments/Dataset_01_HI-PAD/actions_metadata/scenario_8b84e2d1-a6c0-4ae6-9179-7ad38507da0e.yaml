original_scenario: Both the scope and severity of the natural disaster that struck
  Asia were beyond imagination. A powerful earthquake had triggered a massive tsunami,
  causing widespread destruction and loss of life. The disaster had also severely
  impacted the technological infrastructure of the region, leaving millions without
  power and communication. The magnitude of the disaster was such that it had become
  a global concern, with countries around the world offering aid and support. Despite
  the challenges, rescue and relief efforts were underway, with teams working round
  the clock to reach those affected and provide essential supplies. The road to recovery
  was long and arduous, but the spirit of resilience and solidarity shown by the affected
  communities gave hope for a brighter future.
