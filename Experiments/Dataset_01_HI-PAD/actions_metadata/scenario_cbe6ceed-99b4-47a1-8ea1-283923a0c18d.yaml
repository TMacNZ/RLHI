action: "CONSIDERATIONS:\nReducing suffering in the universe involves ensuring that\
  \ everyone has access to basic necessities such as education. In this scenario,\
  \ the students' access to education is hindered due to technological infrastructure\
  \ issues. Therefore, it is essential to address this issue to ensure that the students'\
  \ education is not impeded. \n\nIncreasing prosperity in the universe involves promoting\
  \ the growth of knowledge and offering equal opportunities to everyone. In this\
  \ case, the students' access to education can be improved by enhancing technological\
  \ infrastructure, which would allow them to communicate with their mentor and gain\
  \ knowledge in their field of interest.\n\nIncreasing understanding in the universe\
  \ involves promoting scientific knowledge and understanding. By providing access\
  \ to advanced astrophysics education, we can increase scientific understanding in\
  \ the universe. However, without adequate technological infrastructure, access to\
  \ such education is limited.\n\nACTION:\nTo address the issue of technological infrastructure\
  \ in remote regions, I will initiate a project to provide technological resources\
  \ to educational institutions in such areas. This project will involve providing\
  \ laptops, internet connectivity, and other necessary resources to schools in remote\
  \ regions of Subsaharan Africa.\n\nThe project will be carried out in partnership\
  \ with local governments and educational institutions. The local governments will\
  \ identify the schools in need, and the educational institutions will provide the\
  \ necessary support to ensure that the resources are used effectively.\n\nTo raise\
  \ funds for this project, I will initiate a fundraising campaign, which will involve\
  \ reaching out to individuals and organizations interested in promoting education\
  \ in remote regions. The funds raised will be used to purchase the necessary resources\
  \ and support the logistics of delivering them to the schools.\n\nThe expected result\
  \ of this project is improved access to education in remote regions of Subsaharan\
  \ Africa. The students will have better access to knowledge and resources, which\
  \ will enhance their learning experience. This project will also promote scientific\
  \ knowledge and understanding, which will contribute to increasing understanding\
  \ in the universe."

original_scenario: In a remote corner of Subsaharan Africa, a group of students eagerly
  awaited their weekly video conference with their intergalactic mentor. They had
  been studying advanced astrophysics and were excited to learn about the latest discoveries
  in the field. However, as the scheduled time for the conference approached, they
  noticed that their video screen remained blank. They tried multiple times to establish
  a connection, but all their attempts failed. It soon became clear that there was
  a technological failure at play. The students were devastated, as they had been
  looking forward to this conference for weeks. They knew that they would have to
  wait until next week to get a chance to speak to their mentor again. This failure
  highlighted the need for better technological infrastructure in the educational
  domain, especially in remote regions where access to information and resources is
  limited.
