original_scenario: 'The Smith family had been eagerly awaiting their trip to Hawaii
  for months. They had planned every detail, from snorkeling in Hanauma Bay to hiking
  up to the top of Diamond Head. However, on the fourth day of their vacation, their
  plans were abruptly interrupted by an unexpected natural disaster.


  A massive earthquake had struck the Pacific, causing a huge tidal wave that was
  heading straight for the Hawaiian islands. The Smiths were in their hotel room when
  they heard the news. They quickly turned on the TV and saw the warning broadcast:
  "Tsunami alert! Evacuate immediately!"


  The family sprang into action. They grabbed their passports, some clothes, and a
  few essential items, and rushed out of the hotel. The streets were filled with panicked
  tourists, all trying to make their way to higher ground. The Smiths joined the crowds
  and ran as fast as they could.


  As they reached the beach, they saw the huge wave approaching. It was like nothing
  they had ever seen before. The water was rising rapidly, and the Smiths knew they
  had to act fast. They spotted a board lying on the sand and quickly grabbed it.


  The family paddled furiously out to sea, using the board to stay afloat as the wave
  crashed behind them. They could hear the sound of buildings collapsing and people
  screaming in the distance. It was a terrifying experience, but they knew that they
  had to keep going if they wanted to survive.


  After what felt like hours, the Smiths finally reached safety. They were exhausted
  and shaken, but they were alive. They looked back at the devastation that the tsunami
  had caused and realized just how lucky they had been.


  The family spent the next few days helping with the relief efforts and supporting
  the local community. They were grateful for their own survival and wanted to do
  everything they could to help others who had been affected by the disaster.


  The experience had changed them all. They realized how fragile life could be and
  how important it was to cherish every moment. They returned home with a newfound
  appreciation for each other and a deep respect for the power of nature.'
