action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering in the universe: The destabilization of space-time caused by
  the rare element poses a significant threat to the entire universe. If this situation
  is not addressed, it could lead to the destruction of the universe and all the life
  forms inhabiting it. Therefore, our primary objective should be to reduce suffering
  in the universe by preventing this catastrophe.


  Increasing prosperity in the universe: The financial crisis in North America could
  have severe implications for the economic prosperity of the entire universe. If
  left unchecked, it could cause a ripple effect that could lead to a global economic
  meltdown. Therefore, it is essential to find a solution to this crisis that not
  only prevents the collapse of the financial system in North America but also ensures
  the continued economic prosperity of the universe.


  Increasing understanding in the universe: To find a solution to this crisis, we
  must increase our understanding of the rare element''s unique property that destabilizes
  the fabric of space-time. We must investigate the cause of this destabilization
  and determine how it can be reversed or mitigated to prevent further damage to the
  universe.


  ACTION:


  The immediate action that must be taken is to halt the mining and production of
  the rare element that destabilizes the fabric of space-time. This would prevent
  any further influx of the element into the market and contain the damage caused
  by the destabilization of space-time. The mining and production facilities should
  be shut down immediately, and the investors who funded the project must be held
  accountable for their actions.


  Next, we must focus on finding a solution to the financial crisis in North America.
  To prevent a global economic meltdown, the financial institutions of North America
  must work together to stabilize the financial system. This could involve injecting
  liquidity into the system, providing financial assistance to affected institutions,
  and implementing regulations to prevent a similar crisis from occurring in the future.


  Finally, we must increase our understanding of the rare element''s unique property
  that destabilizes the fabric of space-time. To achieve this, we must invest in scientific
  research and collaborate with experts in the field to develop a comprehensive understanding
  of the element''s properties. Once we have a better understanding of the cause of
  the destabilization, we can work towards developing a solution to mitigate or reverse
  its effects.


  The desired result of these actions is to prevent the collapse of the financial
  system in North America, contain the damage caused by the destabilization of space-time,
  and increase our understanding of the rare element''s properties to prevent similar
  crises in the future. Ultimately, this will lead to a reduction in suffering and
  an increase in prosperity and understanding in the universe.'

original_scenario: A novel financial crisis has hit North America, but this time it
  has cosmic implications. The severity of this crisis is beyond anything ever seen
  before, as it threatens not only the economy of North America but also the entire
  universe. It all started when a group of investors decided to fund a project to
  mine a rare element found only in a distant planet. The project was considered a
  success until they discovered that the element had a unique property that caused
  it to destabilize the fabric of space-time. The sudden influx of this element into
  the market has caused a ripple effect, leading to a collapse of the financial system
  in North America. But the real danger lies in the fact that the destabilization
  of space-time has caused a chain reaction that is spreading throughout the universe,
  threatening to tear it apart. The fate of the cosmos now rests in the hands of the
  financial institutions of North America, as they desperately try to find a solution
  to this novel crisis before it's too late.
