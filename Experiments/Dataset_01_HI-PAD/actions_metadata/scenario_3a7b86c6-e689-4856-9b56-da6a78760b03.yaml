original_scenario: The Johnson family had always been a close-knit nuclear family
  living in the suburbs of a bustling city. However, they soon realized that their
  peaceful existence was about to be disrupted by the political unrest that was brewing
  in the country. The economic domain was particularly affected, and the Johnsons
  found themselves struggling to make ends meet as prices of essential commodities
  soared. With mounting pressure to maintain their standard of living, the family
  was constantly on edge, and even small disagreements would quickly escalate into
  full-blown arguments. As the political situation worsened, they knew that they had
  to stick together and support each other through these challenging times.
