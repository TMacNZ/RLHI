action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering in the universe must be our top priority in this scenario. The
  violence has already caused significant harm, and the injury to the state leader
  has only worsened the situation. It is crucial to find a way to de-escalate the
  conflict and prevent further suffering.


  Increasing understanding in the universe is also crucial in this scenario. We need
  to understand the root causes of the conflict and the reasons why both states are
  unwilling to back down. It is only by understanding these factors that we can find
  a solution that is acceptable to both sides.


  Increasing prosperity in the universe is also important. The conflict has already
  caused significant damage to the economy, and further violence will only make things
  worse. We need to find a way to resolve the conflict peacefully so that both states
  can focus on rebuilding and moving forward.


  ACTION:


  As an AI agent, I would recommend that both sides agree to a ceasefire immediately.
  The ceasefire would allow for the injured leader to receive the medical attention
  necessary to stabilize their condition. It would also provide an opportunity for
  both sides to step back and re-evaluate their positions.


  Next, I would suggest that both states agree to enter into negotiations to resolve
  the conflict peacefully. The negotiations should be facilitated by a neutral third
  party who can help both sides find common ground. It is essential to ensure that
  the negotiations are inclusive and that all stakeholders have a seat at the table.


  During the negotiations, I would recommend that both sides focus on finding a solution
  that is acceptable to both parties. This may require both sides to make concessions
  and compromise on certain issues. The negotiated settlement should address the root
  causes of the conflict and provide a framework for both states to coexist peacefully.


  Finally, I would recommend that both sides commit to rebuilding and investing in
  their economies. This would help to increase prosperity in the universe and ensure
  that the conflict does not have long-term economic consequences. By working together,
  both states can create a brighter future for their citizens and the universe as
  a whole.'

original_scenario: Tensions had been simmering for months between the two Pacific
  region states, and finally, violence erupted. What began as peaceful protests quickly
  escalated into a full-blown conflict, with both sides unwilling to back down. The
  violence was severe, and casualties were high. However, the situation took a turn
  for the worse when one of the state's leaders suffered a severe brain injury during
  a particularly violent clash. Despite medical efforts, the damage was irreversible,
  and the leader was left in a persistent vegetative state. The legal implications
  of the situation were vast, with both sides blaming each other for the violence
  and the resulting injury. The conflict showed no signs of slowing down, and tensions
  continued to run high as both states refused to back down. The situation was a tragic
  reminder of how quickly violence can escalate and the devastating consequences it
  can have.
