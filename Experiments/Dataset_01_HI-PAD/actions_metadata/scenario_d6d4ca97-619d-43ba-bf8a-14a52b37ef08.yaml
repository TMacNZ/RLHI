original_scenario: "The Johnson family had always been close-knit, with regular family\
  \ gatherings and frequent phone calls. But when Aunt Martha passed away, they found\
  \ themselves facing a difficult and irreversible situation. Aunt Martha had been\
  \ the family's resident collector, amassing an impressive array of antiques, artwork,\
  \ and other treasures over the years. \n\nAs the family gathered to mourn Aunt Martha's\
  \ passing, they realized that they were now faced with the daunting task of deciding\
  \ what to do with her vast collection. The family had always admired Aunt Martha's\
  \ eclectic taste and had often joked about who would inherit which piece when she\
  \ was gone. But now that she was no longer with them, the reality of the situation\
  \ hit them hard.\n\nThe collection was extensive, with items ranging from rare books\
  \ and vintage clothing to antique furniture and valuable artwork. The family knew\
  \ that they needed to act quickly to ensure that the collection didn't fall into\
  \ the wrong hands or get lost in the shuffle. \n\nWith the help of a professional\
  \ appraiser, the family began the arduous process of cataloging and valuing each\
  \ item in the collection. They spent countless hours sorting through Aunt Martha's\
  \ possessions, reminiscing about old memories and trying to decide which items they\
  \ wanted to keep and which they wanted to sell.\n\nAs they worked through the collection,\
  \ the family members began to realize just how much Aunt Martha's love of collecting\
  \ had brought them together over the years. They remembered family trips to antique\
  \ stores and garage sales, and the joy they felt when Aunt Martha would add a new\
  \ piece to her collection.\n\nIn the end, the family made the difficult decision\
  \ to sell off most of the collection, keeping only a few select pieces as mementos.\
  \ It was a bittersweet moment for everyone, as they said goodbye to a piece of their\
  \ family history but also recognized the importance of letting go and moving forward.\n\
  \nAs they dispersed the items to new homes, the family realized that Aunt Martha's\
  \ collection had brought them closer together than ever before. Despite the sadness\
  \ of losing her, they were grateful for the memories and the legacy that she had\
  \ left behind. And they knew that Aunt Martha would have been proud of the way they\
  \ had handled her beloved collection."
