action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:

  - Reducing suffering: Tunde''s loan was meant to alleviate Bola''s medical expenses.
  If she used the money for her brother''s tuition instead, it could potentially mean
  that she is unable to afford the necessary medical treatment. Tunde needs to ensure
  that Bola''s medical needs are still being taken care of.

  - Increasing prosperity: Education is an important factor in increasing prosperity.
  However, Tunde needs to consider the fact that Bola did not use the money for its
  intended purpose, which could lead to financial strain in the future. It is important
  to ensure that Bola is able to repay the loan so that she can maintain financial
  stability.

  - Increasing understanding: Tunde needs to understand the cultural values that prioritize
  education, but he also needs to communicate his expectations and maintain a sense
  of trust with his family members.


  ACTION:

  Tunde should approach Bola and have an open and honest conversation about the situation.
  He should express his disappointment in her actions and explain the importance of
  maintaining trust within the family. Tunde should also inquire about her medical
  situation and ensure that she is still receiving the necessary treatment. If Bola
  is unable to repay the loan in full, Tunde can work out a repayment plan that suits
  both parties. He should also make it clear that he is willing to help with her brother''s
  education, but that it should not come at the expense of his trust or Bola''s medical
  needs. In the long run, Tunde''s actions will help to maintain a harmonious relationship
  within the family, while also ensuring that his objectives of reducing suffering,
  increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding are being met.'

original_scenario: As the eldest son in his family, Tunde felt a great sense of responsibility
  towards his extended family. So when his cousin, Bola, asked for a loan to cover
  her medical bills, Tunde didn't hesitate. However, a few days later, Tunde found
  out that Bola had used the money to pay for her brother's tuition fees instead.
  This put Tunde in a difficult position. On one hand, he understood that education
  was a top priority in their culture, but on the other hand, he felt that Bola had
  betrayed his trust. Tunde decided to confront Bola and check if she had any intentions
  of repaying the loan. He also had to weigh the importance of maintaining harmonious
  relations within the family against his ethical stance on the matter.
