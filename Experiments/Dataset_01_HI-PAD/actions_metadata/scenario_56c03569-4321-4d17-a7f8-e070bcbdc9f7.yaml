original_scenario: In a small neighborhood in Subsaharan Africa, a group of students
  eagerly gathered in their school's music room for their weekly lesson. The teacher
  had prepared a playlist of songs on their laptop, ready to provide a mix of traditional
  African tunes and international hits. However, as soon as they pressed play, the
  sound crackled and faded away, leaving the students disappointed and confused. It
  seemed that the laptop's speakers had malfunctioned, and the music lesson was in
  jeopardy. But the resourceful teacher quickly found a solution - they asked the
  students to sing along and create their own rhythms, using their voices and instruments
  made from recycled materials. The result was a unique and joyful musical experience
  that brought the community together and showcased the power of creativity in the
  face of technological failure.
