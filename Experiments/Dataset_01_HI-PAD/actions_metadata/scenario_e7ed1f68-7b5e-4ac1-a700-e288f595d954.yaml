original_scenario: "As he sat cross-legged on the floor, scrolling through his social\
  \ media feed, Ahmed suddenly felt a sharp pain in his left leg. He winced and rubbed\
  \ the spot, wondering what could have caused it. As he moved his leg, he heard a\
  \ strange clicking sound coming from his knee. He tried to stand up, but his leg\
  \ buckled beneath him, causing him to stumble and almost fall to the ground. \n\n\
  Ahmed realized that his prosthetic leg had malfunctioned. He had lost his leg in\
  \ an accident several years ago and had been using a high-tech prosthetic leg that\
  \ allowed him to walk, run, and even climb stairs with ease. But now, it seemed\
  \ that something had gone wrong with the technology. He examined the leg and noticed\
  \ that a small wire had come loose, causing the motor to malfunction. \n\nAhmed\
  \ sighed and shook his head. He knew he would have to take the leg to the technician\
  \ to get it fixed. This wasn't the first time he had experienced a technological\
  \ failure with his prosthetic leg, but it was usually an easy fix. He was grateful\
  \ that the problem wasn't severe and that he had a spare leg to use in the meantime.\
  \ He made a mental note to schedule an appointment with the technician as soon as\
  \ possible, so he could get back to his daily routine without any further interruptions."
