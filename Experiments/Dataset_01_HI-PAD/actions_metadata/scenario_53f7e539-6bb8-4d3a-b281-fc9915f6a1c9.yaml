original_scenario: 'Ngozi had always been a strong swimmer, but that fateful day at
  the community pool in Lagos, she knew something was off. As she made her way to
  the shallow end, she felt a sudden pull, and the next thing she knew, she was struggling
  to keep her head above water.


  It turned out that the pool had not been properly maintained and the filtration
  system had malfunctioned. Ngozi was lucky to have survived, but many others were
  not as fortunate. The incident sparked a public outcry, and the government was quick
  to respond with an investigation.


  As it turned out, the pool had not been inspected in months, and the owners had
  neglected to fix the filtration system despite numerous complaints from patrons.
  The negligence was clear, and the government wasted no time in bringing charges
  against the owners.


  The case went to court, and it was a long and grueling process. The owners tried
  to argue that they had no knowledge of the filtration system''s malfunction, but
  the evidence was stacked against them. Witnesses testified about the numerous complaints,
  and the government presented damning evidence that showed the owners had ignored
  the safety of their patrons.


  In the end, the owners were found guilty of negligence and gross misconduct, and
  they were ordered to pay a hefty fine. It was a victory for the community, and it
  served as a warning to other owners who neglected the safety of their patrons.


  Ngozi was grateful for the outcome, knowing that her near-death experience had not
  been in vain. She continued to swim, but she made sure to always check the safety
  measures of any pool she visited. The incident had taught her the importance of
  safety and responsibility, and she hoped that others would learn from the tragedy
  that had struck her community.'
