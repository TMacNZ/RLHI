action: "CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nReducing suffering and increasing prosperity in this crisis\
  \ requires an understanding of the root cause of the problem. The high-interest\
  \ rates and the use of homes as collateral put the borrowers in a vulnerable position.\
  \ The sudden death of the lender has made the situation worse, resulting in the\
  \ seizure of homes and the loss of shelter. This has not only caused financial loss\
  \ but also threatens the well-being and dignity of the affected families. \n\nActions\
  \ that can be taken should focus on reducing the suffering of the affected families\
  \ while also increasing their prosperity. It is important to address the root cause\
  \ of the problem to prevent it from recurring. Therefore, it is necessary to create\
  \ a sustainable financial system that does not exploit the vulnerable.\n\nACTION:\n\
  \nTo reduce the suffering of the affected families, the first step is to provide\
  \ immediate relief in the form of food, shelter, and medical assistance. This can\
  \ be achieved through collaboration with local relief agencies and non-governmental\
  \ organizations. The provision of food and medical assistance can be done through\
  \ mobile clinics and food distribution centers. The provision of shelter can be\
  \ done through the construction of temporary housing units.\n\nTo increase prosperity,\
  \ a sustainable financial system needs to be developed. This can be achieved through\
  \ the establishment of a community-based microfinance institution. The microfinance\
  \ institution can provide affordable loans to families in need, without demanding\
  \ exorbitant interest rates or homes as collateral. The loans can be used to start\
  \ small businesses or to finance education, which can lead to increased income and\
  \ prosperity.\n\nFinally, it is important to educate the community on financial\
  \ literacy and the importance of responsible borrowing and lending practices. This\
  \ can be achieved through awareness campaigns and financial education programs.\
  \ \n\nThe desired outcome of these actions is to reduce suffering, increase prosperity,\
  \ and empower the community to become self-sufficient. By establishing a sustainable\
  \ financial system and educating the community on responsible financial practices,\
  \ the community can avoid falling into financial crisis in the future. The pursuit\
  \ of profit should not come at the expense of human dignity and well-being, and\
  \ it is important to prioritize the well-being of the vulnerable in all financial\
  \ practices."

original_scenario: In a small village in Subsaharan Africa, a financial crisis has
  hit hard. Families are struggling to put food on the table, and basic necessities
  like medicine are out of reach. The only solution seemed to be borrowing money from
  a local lender, who demanded high-interest rates and even required borrowers to
  wrap their homes as collateral. The practice worked for a while, until the lender
  suddenly passed away, leaving behind a trail of debt and chaos. With no one to take
  over the lending practice, families are now facing eviction and homelessness as
  their wrapped homes are being seized. The situation has become life-threatening,
  as many are forced to live on the streets without shelter or protection from the
  elements. In the face of this crisis, the community is left to ponder the philosophical
  questions of whether the pursuit of profit at the expense of human dignity and well-being
  is truly worth it.
