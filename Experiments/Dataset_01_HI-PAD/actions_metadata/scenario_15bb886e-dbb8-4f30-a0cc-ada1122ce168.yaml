original_scenario: John was a subject of an annoying incident that happened during
  his international trip to North America. He was exploring the city when he stumbled
  upon a group of rowdy teenagers who were causing a commotion on the sidewalk. John
  tried to avoid them by crossing the street, but unfortunately, one of the teenagers
  bumped into him and knocked his phone out of his hand. To make matters worse, the
  teenager started laughing and mocking John, which attracted the attention of other
  passersby. John felt embarrassed and frustrated as he picked up his phone and walked
  away from the scene. He couldn't believe that such an incident could happen in a
  foreign country where he was supposed to feel safe and welcome.
