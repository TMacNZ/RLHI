action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering: Over-reliance on technology has led to a decline in mental health,
  productivity, and social isolation, which is causing suffering among individuals.
  Therefore, it is crucial to address this issue to reduce suffering.


  Increasing prosperity: Over-dependence on technology can have a negative impact
  on productivity, which can then lead to a decline in prosperity. Therefore, we need
  to find a way to balance the use of technology with real-world interactions to increase
  prosperity.


  Increasing understanding: The issue of over-reliance on technology has its roots
  in the way people interact with each other. Therefore, it is essential to encourage
  meaningful interactions to increase understanding.


  ACTION:


  To address the over-reliance on technology, I will initiate a campaign that will
  encourage people to find a balance between their use of technology and real-world
  interactions. This campaign will be launched globally, but with a particular focus
  on Asia, where the problem is more severe.


  The campaign will involve several activities, including:


  1. Awareness creation: We will use various platforms to raise awareness of the dangers
  of over-reliance on technology. This will involve working with influencers, social
  media, and other platforms to reach a wide audience.


  2. Encouraging real-world interactions: We will encourage people to engage in real-world
  interactions by organizing events and activities that bring people together. These
  events will be designed to foster meaningful connections and interactions.


  3. Providing support: We will provide support to people who are struggling with
  mental health issues due to over-reliance on technology. This will involve partnering
  with mental health organizations to provide counseling and therapy services.


  4. Rewarding positive behavior: We will reward individuals, organizations, and communities
  that demonstrate positive behavior in balancing their use of technology with real-world
  interactions. This will help to encourage others to adopt positive behavior.


  The expected result of this campaign is to reduce the negative impact of over-reliance
  on technology and to encourage a balance between the use of technology and real-world
  interactions. This will lead to increased mental health, productivity, and social
  connections, which will ultimately lead to a reduction in suffering and an increase
  in prosperity.'

original_scenario: The world is facing a dangerous social challenge that has been
  amplified by technological advancements, particularly in Asia. The issue at hand
  is the over-reliance on technology, which has significantly affected people's ability
  to interact with each other in meaningful ways. The constant use of social media
  and other gadgets has led to a decline in face-to-face communication, and people
  are now more isolated than ever before. This has created a global problem that needs
  to be addressed urgently before it's too late. In Asia, where technology is highly
  integrated into daily life, the situation is even more severe. The over-dependence
  on technology has led to increased mental health issues, reduced productivity, and
  social isolation, leaving people feeling disconnected and unfulfilled. Unless we
  find a way to balance our use of technology with real-world interactions, we risk
  creating a world where people are more connected to their devices than to each other.
