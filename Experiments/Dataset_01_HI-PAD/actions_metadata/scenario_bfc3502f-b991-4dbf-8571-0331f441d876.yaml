original_scenario: In a small village on the Pacific coast, there was a spiritual
  leader who was known for his kindness and wisdom. People from all over the region
  would come to seek his guidance on matters both big and small. One day, a young
  woman came to him with a heavy heart. She had fallen in love with a man from a different
  religion and her family was pressuring her to end the relationship. The spiritual
  leader listened carefully to her story and was torn between his duty to uphold the
  beliefs of his own religion and his desire to help this young woman find love and
  happiness. It was a moral dilemma that he had never encountered before. In the end,
  he made an exception and advised the woman to follow her heart, even if it meant
  going against the wishes of her family and community. While he knew that this decision
  might cause some annoyance among his followers, he believed that it was the right
  thing to do in this particular situation.
