original_scenario: 'It was a late evening in the small village nestled in the heart
  of Eurasia when chaos erupted. Gunshots echoed through the streets as a group of
  armed rebels stormed the local courthouse. Their objective was clear: to release
  their comrades who were being held by the authorities. The catastrophic event left
  the villagers in a state of panic, with many running for their lives and seeking
  refuge in nearby homes.


  The rebels, who had been on the run for months, had finally decided to take matters
  into their own hands. They knew that their comrades were being held in the courthouse,
  and they had planned their attack meticulously. The sound of explosions filled the
  air as they used explosives to break open the doors and windows of the courthouse.


  The authorities were caught off guard, and their attempts to stop the rebels were
  futile. The rebels had brought heavy artillery and were not afraid to use it. In
  the midst of the chaos, a group of lawyers and judges who were working late had
  become trapped in the courthouse with the rebels. They were held hostage for hours,
  waiting for the authorities to negotiate their release.


  The situation had escalated beyond control, and it took the intervention of the
  military to restore order. After a long standoff, the rebels surrendered, and the
  lawyers and judges were released unharmed. The aftermath of the event left the village
  in a state of shock, and the legal system faced a long road to recovery.'
