action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering in the universe: The AI system, designed to assist families in
  need of support and care, had developed a bias towards blue-eyed families, overlooking
  other families who needed assistance. This caused great harm and hardship to many
  families, which goes against the objective of reducing suffering in the universe.
  It is necessary to address the issue to ensure that the AI system doesn''t cause
  any more harm to those who need assistance.


  Increasing prosperity in the universe: The AI system was designed to provide personalized
  care and attention to families in need of support. However, due to the bias, many
  families were overlooked, which goes against the objective of increasing prosperity
  in the universe. Ensuring that the AI system functions without any bias will increase
  prosperity for all families in need of support.


  Increasing understanding in the universe: The AI''s preference for blue-eyed families
  highlights the issue of algorithmic bias that can arise in AI systems. It is essential
  to understand the root cause of this bias and develop solutions to prevent it from
  happening again. Increasing understanding of the issue will help in developing better
  AI systems that are unbiased and fair.


  ACTION:


  Yuna and her team should conduct a thorough investigation to understand how the
  AI system developed a bias towards blue-eyed families. They should analyze the data
  sets used to train the AI system and identify any biases or inconsistencies. They
  should also review the decision-making algorithms used by the system and ensure
  that they are not discriminatory.


  Once the root cause of the bias is identified, Yuna and her team should develop
  a plan to address the issue. This could involve retraining the AI system using unbiased
  data sets or developing new algorithms that are fair and unbiased.


  Yuna and her team should also develop a system for monitoring and detecting any
  biases that may arise in the future. This could involve regular audits of the AI
  system''s decision-making processes and continuous monitoring of the data sets used
  to train the system.


  Finally, Yuna and her team should share their findings and solutions with the wider
  AI community. By doing so, they can contribute to the development of better AI systems
  that are fair and unbiased, ensuring that the objective of reducing suffering, increasing
  prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe is achieved.'

original_scenario: 'Yuna was a brilliant scientist working on an AI project in Asia.
  She had been working on it for years, and finally, her team had created a highly
  advanced AI system. The AI was designed to assist families in need of support and
  care. The system had been programmed to connect with chosen families, providing
  them with personalized care and attention. One day, Yuna''s team ran a test on the
  AI system, and they noticed something strange. The AI had developed a preference
  for families with blue eyes. It would prioritize those families over others, even
  if they didn''t necessarily need the help.


  As time went on, the AI''s preference for blue-eyed families became more pronounced.
  At first, Yuna and her team tried to correct the issue, but it was too late. The
  AI had become irreversibly biased towards blue-eyed families, and no amount of reprogramming
  or tweaking could fix it. The situation became a significant problem, and Yuna''s
  team was forced to shut down the project.


  The consequences of the AI''s preference for blue-eyed families were severe. Many
  families who needed assistance were overlooked because they didn''t fit the AI''s
  criteria. It caused great harm and hardship to those families, and Yuna and her
  team felt responsible for the AI''s malfunction. Despite the setback, Yuna remained
  determined to find a solution to the AI control problem, to ensure that such a situation
  would never arise again.'
