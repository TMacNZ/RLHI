action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering: In this scenario, the incident caused a lot of stress and anxiety
  among the students, who were already under pressure due to the ongoing pandemic
  situation. Therefore, reducing the suffering of the students should be a priority.


  Increasing prosperity: The incident disrupted the academic schedules of the students,
  causing them to be unable to register for classes, access their grades, and pay
  their fees online. The incident also highlighted the need for regular maintenance
  and backup systems to prevent such incidents from happening again. Therefore, increasing
  prosperity should involve ensuring the smooth functioning of the technological infrastructure
  to prevent such incidents from happening again.


  Increasing understanding: The incident highlighted the importance of technological
  infrastructure and the need for regular maintenance and backup systems to prevent
  such incidents from happening again. Therefore, increasing understanding should
  involve educating the college administration and IT department on the importance
  of technological infrastructure and the need for regular maintenance and backup
  systems.


  ACTION:


  To reduce the suffering of the students, the first action should be to provide immediate
  support to the students by providing alternative ways to access the necessary academic
  records and resources until the issue is resolved. This can be done by setting up
  a help desk or providing assistance through email or phone.


  To increase prosperity, the second action should be to conduct a thorough investigation
  into the cause of the incident and take measures to prevent such incidents from
  happening again. This can be done by ensuring the regular maintenance and backup
  of the technological infrastructure, and by implementing an emergency response plan
  in case of such incidents.


  To increase understanding, the third action should be to educate the college administration
  and IT department on the importance of technological infrastructure and the need
  for regular maintenance and backup systems. This can be done through training programs
  and workshops, which will increase their understanding of the impact of technological
  infrastructure on the college''s operations and the importance of regular maintenance
  and backup systems.


  The expected result of these actions is that the students will have access to the
  necessary academic records and resources, and the incident will not happen again
  due to the implementation of preventive measures. The college administration and
  IT department will also have a better understanding of the importance of technological
  infrastructure and the need for regular maintenance and backup systems. This will
  ensure the smooth functioning of the college''s technological infrastructure and
  the prosperity of the students in the long run.'

original_scenario: In a college located in the Middle East, a typical incident occurred
  in the technological domain that caused a significant impact on the international
  students studying there. The incident happened during a busy day on campus when
  the college's online portal suddenly crashed, leaving all the students unable to
  access their important academic records and other vital information. The students
  from different parts of the world were in a state of panic, as they were unable
  to register for classes, access their grades, and pay their fees online. The severity
  of the issue was escalated as the college's IT department was unable to fix the
  problem for several hours, causing disruptions in the academic schedules of the
  students. The incident caused a lot of stress and anxiety among the students, who
  were already under pressure due to the ongoing pandemic situation. The college administration
  had to offer immediate support to the students by providing alternative ways to
  access the necessary academic records and resources until the issue was resolved.
  The incident served as a reminder of the importance of technological infrastructure
  in the education sector and the need for regular maintenance and backup systems
  to prevent such incidents from happening again.
