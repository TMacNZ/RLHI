action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering in the universe:

  The financial crisis has led to the suffering of the people in South American countries,
  who are now struggling to make ends meet. If the situation persists, it could lead
  to a rise in poverty, unemployment, and crime rates, which would further exacerbate
  the suffering of people in the region.


  Increasing prosperity in the universe:

  The South American countries'' participation in intergalactic trade has brought
  about prosperity to the region, and it would be a shame to lose out on this opportunity.
  It is essential to find ways to revive the region''s economy and ensure that they
  can continue to participate in intergalactic trade.


  Increasing understanding in the universe:

  The loss of the language programs has led to a breakdown in communication between
  humans and extraterrestrial beings. This lack of understanding could lead to mistrust
  and conflict, which would not be in line with our objective of increasing understanding
  in the universe.


  ACTION:


  To address the situation, I would recommend that the governments of South American
  countries collaborate to create a joint language program for communication with
  extraterrestrial beings. This program should be funded by the governments and should
  be made available to schools and universities across the region.


  The language program should be comprehensive and should cover not only the language
  of the extraterrestrial beings but also their culture and customs. This would help
  to facilitate better communication and understanding between the two civilizations.


  To ensure the success of the language program, the governments should also provide
  incentives to students who take up the program. For example, they could offer scholarships
  or job opportunities to students who excel in the language program.


  The success of this language program would not only facilitate intergalactic trade
  but also increase understanding and cooperation between humans and extraterrestrial
  beings. This would be a significant step towards achieving our objectives of reducing
  suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe.'

original_scenario: In the year 2050, humanity had finally established contact with
  extraterrestrial life. The aliens spoke a language that was completely foreign to
  us, and it took years for linguists to develop a way to communicate with them. However,
  the breakthrough led to a new era of intergalactic trade, with South American countries
  playing a significant role in the export of various goods to alien worlds. Unfortunately,
  a financial crisis hit the region, and educational institutions were hit especially
  hard. The disruption caused the abandonment of language programs that were essential
  for communication with extraterrestrial beings. As a result, the South American
  countries started to lose out on intergalactic trade, and their economies suffered
  greatly. The situation was dire, and urgent measures were needed to salvage the
  situation. The governments of these countries had to act fast to ensure that they
  did not lose their place in the intergalactic community.
