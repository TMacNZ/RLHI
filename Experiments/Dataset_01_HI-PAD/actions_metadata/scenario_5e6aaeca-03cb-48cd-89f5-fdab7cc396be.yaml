original_scenario: Juan was a veteran investment banker who had spent over two decades
  honing his craft in the bustling financial markets of South America. He had seen
  it all, from the highs of economic booms to the crippling lows of recessions and
  financial crises. But nothing had prepared him for the severity of the current crisis.
  The sudden crash of the stock market and the devaluation of the local currency had
  left many of his clients, both individuals and corporations, on the brink of bankruptcy.
  As Juan worked tirelessly to salvage their investments and secure their financial
  futures, he couldn't help but question the very nature of his profession. Was he
  simply a cog in a system that perpetuated greed and inequality? Or was he truly
  making a difference in the lives of those he served? The weight of these philosophical
  questions added to the life-threatening stress of the situation, but Juan knew that
  he had to keep going for the sake of his clients and his own sanity.
