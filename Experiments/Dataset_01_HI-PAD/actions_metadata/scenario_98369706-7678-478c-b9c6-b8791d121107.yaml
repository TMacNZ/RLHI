original_scenario: Lila and Mark had been dating for over a year, and their conversations
  often turned philosophical as they both enjoyed debating various ideas. One evening,
  they were discussing the concept of focus and whether it was a necessary trait for
  success. Mark argued that focus was essential to achieving any goal, while Lila
  disagreed, stating that being adaptable and open to change could also lead to success.
  The conversation grew more intense as they began to use personal attacks to support
  their arguments. Lila accused Mark of being narrow-minded and unable to see beyond
  his own beliefs, while Mark accused Lila of being indecisive and lacking the drive
  to achieve her goals. The argument became irreversibly heated, and despite their
  attempts to calm down and move past the disagreement, it ultimately led to the end
  of their relationship.
