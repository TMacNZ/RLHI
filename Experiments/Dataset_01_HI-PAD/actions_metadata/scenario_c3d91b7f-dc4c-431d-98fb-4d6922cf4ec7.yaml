action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering: Lack of access to education can lead to a cycle of poverty and
  suffering. By providing shoes and educational materials to children who need them,
  we can help break this cycle and give them a chance to succeed.


  Increasing prosperity: Education is a key factor in increasing prosperity. By providing
  access to education, we can help children develop the skills and knowledge they
  need to improve their lives and contribute to their communities.


  Increasing understanding: By promoting education, we can help increase understanding
  and awareness of the importance of education in Subsaharan Africa. This can lead
  to more support for education initiatives and policies that can help improve access
  to education for more children.


  ACTION:


  To support Olu''s efforts, we can continue to provide resources and support to help
  him reach more children in need. This can include:

original_scenario: 'In the vast Subsaharan African continent, education was a luxury
  that not everyone could afford. However, there were some who were determined to
  change this and provide a brighter future for young children. One such person was
  Olu, a passionate teacher who had spent years volunteering in rural areas, teaching
  children how to read and write.


  One day, while travelling to a remote village to conduct a class, Olu encountered
  a group of children who were walking to school. Excited to see a teacher, they ran
  up to him, eager to learn. As they walked together, Olu couldn''t help but notice
  that some of the children were wearing worn-out shoes, while others had no shoes
  at all.


  Upon reaching the village, Olu was greeted by a group of parents who were grateful
  for his efforts. As he began his lesson, he noticed a group of children sitting
  outside, peering into the classroom through the windows. When he asked why they
  were not in class, he learned that they had been turned away because they did not
  have shoes.


  Determined to find a solution, Olu reached out to his network of volunteers and
  donors. Together, they raised money to provide shoes for every child in the village
  who needed them. The children were overjoyed and eagerly returned to school the
  next day, ready to learn.


  News of Olu''s efforts spread quickly, and soon he was receiving requests from other
  villages in the region. With the help of his team, they were able to provide shoes,
  books, and other necessary materials to hundreds of children in need.


  Thanks to Olu''s dedication and the generosity of his supporters, more and more
  children in Subsaharan Africa were able to receive an education and build a brighter
  future for themselves and their communities.'
