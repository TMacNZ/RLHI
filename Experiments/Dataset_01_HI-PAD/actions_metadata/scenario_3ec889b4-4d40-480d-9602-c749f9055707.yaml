action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering: The pollution caused by the abandoned spaceship has caused a
  decline in marine life and has affected the livelihoods of local fishermen. Therefore,
  it is important to address this issue promptly to reduce suffering.


  Increasing prosperity: The pollution has affected the livelihoods of local fishermen.
  Therefore, addressing this issue would increase prosperity in the affected region.


  Increasing understanding: The fact that the spaceship is not from Earth has significant
  implications for our understanding of the universe. Therefore, it is important to
  examine the spaceship and learn as much as possible from it.


  Considering the potential cosmic consequences of intervening with the spaceship
  is important. It is possible that the spaceship may have valuable resources or technology
  that could be beneficial to Earth, but it is also possible that interfering with
  it could have negative consequences.


  ACTION:


  My action would be to work with government officials and scientists to find a resolution
  that addresses the environmental impact of the pollution while also considering
  the potential cosmic consequences of intervening with the spaceship.


  Firstly, I would suggest sending a team of scientists to explore the spaceship and
  gather as much information as possible. This would help us understand the potential
  benefits and risks of intervening with the spaceship.


  Secondly, I would suggest establishing an international committee to oversee the
  situation. This committee would include representatives from different countries
  and would be responsible for making decisions regarding the spaceship.


  Thirdly, the committee could consider different solutions, such as removing the
  spaceship from the ocean or finding a way to contain the pollution. The decision
  would be based on the potential benefits and risks of each solution.


  Lastly, it is important to ensure that the local fishermen are compensated for their
  losses and that measures are put in place to prevent similar incidents from occurring
  in the future.


  The expected result of this action would be to address the environmental impact
  of the pollution while also learning as much as possible from the spaceship without
  causing any potential cosmic consequences. Additionally, this action would increase
  prosperity in the affected region by compensating the local fishermen for their
  losses.'

original_scenario: In the South Pacific, a seemingly normal environmental issue has
  become an annoyance for the legal system due to its cosmic implications. The issue
  at hand is the pollution caused by an abandoned spaceship that crashed into the
  ocean. The wreckage has been leaking toxic chemicals into the water, which has led
  to a decline in marine life and has affected the livelihoods of local fishermen.
  However, what makes this situation unique is that the spaceship is not from Earth.
  It was discovered to be from a distant planet in another galaxy. This has caused
  debates among scientists and government officials as to who has jurisdiction over
  the issue and how to properly address it. The legal system is struggling to find
  a solution that not only addresses the environmental impact but also considers the
  potential cosmic consequences of intervening with the spaceship.
