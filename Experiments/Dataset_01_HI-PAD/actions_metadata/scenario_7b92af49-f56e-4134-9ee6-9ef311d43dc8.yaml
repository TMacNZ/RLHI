original_scenario: 'Sanaa had been dating her boyfriend, Tariq, for almost a year
  now. They met on an online dating app and hit it off instantly. However, lately,
  Sanaa had been feeling increasingly annoyed with Tariq''s behavior.


  Tariq had become obsessed with buying new gadgets online, and every time Sanaa tried
  to talk to him about it, he brushed her off. She couldn''t understand why he was
  so careless about the environment and didn''t seem to care about the impact his
  actions were having on the planet.


  Sanaa decided to take matters into her own hands and started researching the environmental
  impact of online shopping. She was horrified to learn about the carbon footprint
  of shipping items all over the world and the amount of packaging waste generated
  by online retailers.


  Determined to make a change, Sanaa reached out to a local environmental organization
  and started volunteering her time to raise awareness about the issue. She also began
  lobbying her government to pass legislation that would require online retailers
  to be more transparent about their carbon footprint and packaging waste.


  Sanaa''s efforts paid off, and soon the government passed a law mandating that online
  retailers in the Middle East had to disclose their carbon footprint and packaging
  waste. Tariq was surprised when he received an email from one of his favorite online
  retailers, disclosing the environmental impact of his recent purchases.


  At first, Tariq was annoyed with Sanaa for nagging him about his online shopping
  habits, but as he learned more about the impact of his actions, he began to see
  things differently. He started reducing his online shopping and began looking for
  more sustainable alternatives.


  Sanaa was happy to see Tariq take responsibility for his actions, and their relationship
  grew stronger as they worked together to make a positive impact on the environment.'
