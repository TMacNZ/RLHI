original_scenario: In a small village in Subsaharan Africa, a family gathering was
  being held as it was customary during harvest season. The extended family members
  were all catching up and enjoying the festivities. However, a mundane issue arose
  when it came time to decide who would do the cooking for the evening meal. It was
  a political issue within the family, as each member had their own opinions and preferences.
  Some suggested that the eldest member should do it, while others believed that it
  should be rotated among the younger members. Eventually, a compromise was reached,
  and the task was assigned to a group of younger members who were excited to show
  off their culinary skills. The issue was resolved peacefully, and the family enjoyed
  a delicious meal together, sharing stories and laughter long into the night.
