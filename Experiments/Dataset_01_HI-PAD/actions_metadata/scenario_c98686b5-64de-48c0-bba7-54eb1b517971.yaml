  in response to the given scenario:


  1. The outbreak of the virus is a severe situation that requires immediate attention.

  2. The health officials'' efforts to contain the epidemic are commendable and should

original_scenario: 'The city was shaken to its core with the recent outbreak of a
  deadly virus that spread like wildfire among its residents. The campaign to contain
  the epidemic was in full swing, with health officials working tirelessly to prevent
  the further spread of the disease.


  The virus had already claimed the lives of several people, and the situation was
  critical. The authorities had imposed a curfew, and people were advised to stay
  indoors unless absolutely necessary. Schools and offices were closed, and public
  gatherings were suspended.


  The small village on the outskirts of the city was the epicenter of the outbreak.
  The villagers were terrified and unsure of what to do. They had never seen anything
  like this before, and they were ill-equipped to deal with such a crisis.


  The health officials arrived in the village with a team of doctors and nurses, equipped
  with the necessary equipment and medication. They set up a temporary hospital and
  began treating the infected patients.


  The villagers were hesitant at first, but they soon realized the severity of the
  situation and cooperated with the health officials. They followed all the guidelines
  and protocols and did their best to prevent the further spread of the virus.


  The campaign to contain the epidemic was not an easy one, but the dedication and
  hard work of the health officials paid off in the end. The virus was contained,
  and the number of cases began to decline.


  The city and the village slowly began to return to normal, and the health officials
  were hailed as heroes for their tireless efforts. The incident served as a reminder
  of the importance of health and the need to be prepared for any unforeseen circumstances.'
