action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:

  In this scenario, the objective of increasing prosperity in the universe is most
  relevant. The decrease in sales of the snack may cause financial losses for the
  company, which can lead to unemployment for the employees and decreased economic
  growth in the region. Additionally, the decrease in sales may lead to the company
  cutting corners to save costs, which can affect the quality of the product and lead
  to more negative consequences. Therefore, it is important to act quickly to address
  the issue and regain consumer trust.


  However, the objective of reducing suffering should also be considered. While the
  decrease in sales may not have a severe impact on people''s lives, it may still
  cause stress and uncertainty for the employees and their families. Therefore, it
  is important to handle the situation with empathy and care.


  ACTION:

  As an AI agent, one action that can be taken is to help the company identify the
  cause of the taste change. By analyzing data from the production process and customer
  feedback, the AI can identify the area where the issue occurred and suggest possible
  solutions. Additionally, the AI can monitor the company''s efforts to rectify the
  situation and provide feedback on the effectiveness of the solutions.


  To regain consumer trust, the company can launch a marketing campaign that emphasizes
  the steps taken to address the issue and provide reassurance that the snack will
  return to its original taste. The company can also offer discounts or promotions
  to incentivize customers to try the snack again.


  Finally, to address the objective of reducing suffering, the company can communicate
  transparently with its employees about the situation and provide support if needed.
  For example, the company can offer counseling services or financial assistance to
  employees who may be affected by the decrease in sales.


  The desired result of these actions is to regain consumer trust and confidence in
  the product, increase sales, and prevent any negative impact on the employees and
  the economy. By addressing the situation promptly and effectively, the company can
  continue to prosper while reducing any potential suffering caused by the decrease
  in sales.'

original_scenario: The taste of one particular ingredient used in a popular snack
  has been altered, causing a small but noticeable difference in flavor. This has
  led to a decrease in sales in North America, which is one of the largest markets
  for the snack. While the issue is not severe enough to cause a major financial impact,
  it is still a concern for the company's economic performance. The company has launched
  an investigation to determine the cause of the taste change and is working to rectify
