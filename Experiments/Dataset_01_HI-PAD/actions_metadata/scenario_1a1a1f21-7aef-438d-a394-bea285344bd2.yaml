original_scenario: "Ana had grown up with her best friend, Maria, who lived right\
  \ next door. They did everything together, from playing dress-up to sharing secrets.\
  \ However, when Ana's father lost his job, the family was forced to move to a new\
  \ city in South America to find work. The move was difficult for Ana, especially\
  \ since she had to leave her best friend behind. \n\nYears passed, and Ana had lost\
  \ touch with Maria. However, one day, Ana received a frantic call from Maria's mother,\
  \ who still lived in their old neighborhood. Maria's family had been caught in the\
  \ middle of a violent conflict, and their home was destroyed in a catastrophic explosion.\
  \ Maria's parents were killed instantly, and Maria was badly injured. \n\nWithout\
  \ hesitation, Ana packed her bags and made the long journey back to her old neighborhood.\
  \ When she arrived, she found Maria in a hospital, barely conscious and fighting\
  \ for her life. Ana stayed by Maria's side, holding her hand and offering words\
  \ of encouragement. Despite the chaos and violence that surrounded them, Ana was\
  \ determined to be there for her friend in her time of need."
