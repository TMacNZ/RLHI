original_scenario: The financial crisis in Eurasia had a significant impact on the
  educational domain, causing a great deal of annoyance for professionals in the field.
  Such was the case for Maria, a seasoned educator who had spent her entire career
  teaching at a local university. As the crisis deepened, the university was forced
  to make severe budget cuts, resulting in a reduced number of teaching positions
  and increased class sizes. Maria found herself teaching classes with nearly double
  the number of students she was used to, which made it difficult to provide the personalized
  attention that she believed was essential for effective teaching. In addition, the
  university was unable to invest in new technologies and teaching resources, making
  it challenging to keep up with the latest advancements in the field. Despite these
  challenges, Maria remained committed to providing her students with the best possible
  education, and she continued to work tirelessly to find creative solutions to the
  problems she faced.
