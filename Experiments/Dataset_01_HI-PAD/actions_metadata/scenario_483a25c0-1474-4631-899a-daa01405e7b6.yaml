original_scenario: As I sat at the kitchen table, I received a phone call from my
  dear Aunt in Europe. Her voice was trembling, and she was clearly distraught. She
  explained that my cousin, who I had grown up with, was in the hospital with a life-threatening
  illness. My heart sank as she spoke, and I could feel a lump forming in my throat.
  It was hard to imagine my cousin, who was always so full of life, struggling to
  stay alive. As I hung up the phone, I couldn't help but think about the fragility
  of life and how we often take it for granted. It made me realize that we should
  cherish the time we have with our loved ones and never take a single moment for
  granted.
