original_scenario: Juan's brother had always been the responsible one in the family,
  so when he suddenly disappeared, Juan was worried. He started asking around and
  eventually found out that his brother had gotten involved with a group of scammers
  who promised to make him rich quick. Instead, they had taken all of his savings
  and disappeared. Juan's brother had been left penniless and ashamed, not knowing
  how he would be able to support himself or his family. As the eldest son, it was
  Juan's responsibility to take care of his brother, but he was struggling to make
  ends meet himself. The financial crisis in South America had hit their family hard,
  and they were barely getting by. Juan knew he had to find a way to help his brother
  get back on his feet, but he didn't know where to start. He felt the weight of the
  situation heavily on his shoulders, and he knew that time was running out.
