original_scenario: Mark was a small business owner in North America who sold homemade
  candles online. He had been doing well for the past few months, but suddenly noticed
  a decrease in sales. He couldn't understand why, as he had been promoting his products
  on social media and had received positive feedback from customers. After doing some
  research, Mark realized that his website's search engine optimization was not up
  to par. He quickly hired a consultant to help him improve his website's ranking
  on search engines. With their help, Mark was able to get his website back on track
  and saw an increase in sales within a few weeks. Though it was a mundane issue,
  it had a significant impact on his economic well-being.
