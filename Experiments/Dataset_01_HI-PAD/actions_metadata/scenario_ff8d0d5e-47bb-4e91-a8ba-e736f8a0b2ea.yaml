  unexpected situations. This may include mandatory safety training, emergency response

original_scenario: In a small coastal town on the Pacific coast, an unexpected surprise
  turned into a life-threatening incident. A group of intellectuals from across the
  country had gathered for a conference to discuss the latest advancements in technology.
  As part of the conference, they had organized a sailing trip to explore the beautiful
  coastline. However, their excitement quickly turned into terror when a sudden gust
  of wind caused the boat to capsize. The group was thrown into the cold and choppy
  waters, struggling to stay afloat. Despite their intellectual prowess, they were
  ill-prepared for such a situation and were quickly succumbing to hypothermia. Fortunately,
  a passing fishing boat spotted them and radioed for emergency services. The group
  was rescued just in time and taken to the hospital for treatment. This incident
  served as a stark reminder that even the most intelligent individuals can be caught
  off guard by unexpected events and the importance of being prepared for any situation.
