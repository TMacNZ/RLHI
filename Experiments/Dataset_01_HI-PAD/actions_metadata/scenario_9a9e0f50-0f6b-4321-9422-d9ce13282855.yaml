  In North America, the typical challenges we face are mostly social and environmental.
  The world is changing, and we must adapt to these changes. One of the biggest challenges
  that people in North America are facing is the environmental crisis. The earth's
  climate is changing, and this is causing a lot of problems. The air we breathe is
  polluted, and the water we drink is contaminated. This is having a negative impact
  on our health, and it's affecting the quality of life for many people. We must take
  action to address this challenge if we want to ensure a better future for ourselves
  and for generations to come. It's time to make changes in our daily lives to reduce
  our impact on the environment.
