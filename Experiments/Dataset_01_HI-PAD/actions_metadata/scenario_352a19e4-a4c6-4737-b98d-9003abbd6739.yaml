original_scenario: In South Asia, a devastating natural disaster struck a technological
  warehouse, causing long-lasting damage to the facility. The incident happened when
  an earthquake hit the region, causing the shelves to collapse, and the equipment
  to fall and shatter. The workers were caught off guard as they were trying to secure
  the equipment but couldn't keep up with the intensity of the quake. The devastation
  was so severe that it caused the warehouse to shut down, and the company had to
  bear significant financial losses. The incident highlighted the need for better
  disaster management and safety protocols in the region to mitigate the impact of
  such natural disasters. The company had to rebuild the warehouse from scratch and
  invest in better infrastructure to ensure the safety of its workers and equipment
  in the future.
