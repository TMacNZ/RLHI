action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering: The survivors of the accident experienced significant suffering
  during their time stranded in space. It is important to acknowledge and address
  this suffering, both in terms of their physical needs (such as access to medical
  care and food) and their emotional needs (such as counseling and support).


  Increasing prosperity: The survivors have been given a chance to start afresh on
  a new planet. However, it is important to consider how we can ensure their long-term
  prosperity in this new environment. This may involve providing resources and support
  to help them build new lives and communities.


  Increasing understanding: The survivors'' experience offers valuable insights into
  the challenges and risks of intergalactic travel. It is important to learn from
  their experience and use this knowledge to improve space travel safety and protocols.


  ACTION:


  To address the survivors'' physical and emotional needs, I will work with medical
  professionals and counselors to provide them with appropriate care and support.
  This may involve providing access to medical facilities and counseling services,
  as well as connecting them with other survivors of similar experiences for mutual
  support.


  To support the survivors in building new lives on the new planet, I will work with
  local authorities to provide resources and assistance as needed. This may include
  access to education and training programs, as well as financial support to help
  them start businesses or acquire housing.


  To increase understanding of the risks and challenges of intergalactic travel, I
  will work with space agencies and researchers to analyze the incident and identify
  areas for improvement. This may involve making recommendations for new safety protocols,
  developing new technologies to reduce the risk of accidents, or advocating for increased
  funding for space travel research.


  Overall, my goal is to ensure that the survivors of the accident are given the support
  and resources they need to rebuild their lives, while also using their experience
  to improve the safety and prosperity of intergalactic travel for future generations.'

original_scenario: 'In the year 2500, humanity had colonized several planets across
  the galaxy. But with the vast distances between these planets, intergalactic travel
  was a dangerous affair. It was during one such journey that a group of immigrants
  from Asia found themselves in the middle of a catastrophic accident.


  The immigrants were on their way to a new planet, where they hoped to start a new
  life. As they traveled through space, their ship suddenly malfunctioned, causing
  a massive explosion that destroyed most of the vessel. Only a handful of survivors
  managed to escape in the emergency pods.


  These survivors were stranded in the vastness of space, with no hope of rescue.
  They were alone, scared, and unsure of their fate. But despite the gravity of the
  situation, they found solace in each other''s company. They shared their stories,
  their hopes, and their dreams, and formed a tight-knit community that helped them
  cope with their situation.


  As they drifted through space, the immigrants faced many challenges. They had to
  ration their supplies, deal with the emotional toll of being stranded, and confront
  their fears of never being rescued. But through it all, they remained resilient,
  determined to survive.


  Finally, after weeks of drifting through space, the survivors were rescued by a
  passing spaceship. They were taken to a new planet, where they were given a chance
  to start afresh. The immigrants were grateful for their second chance at life, but
  the memories of their harrowing experience would stay with them forever.


  The incident had a profound emotional impact on the survivors. It had forced them
  to confront their mortality, and had shown them the value of community and companionship.
  They were forever changed by the experience, but they knew that they had emerged
  stronger and more resilient than ever before.'
