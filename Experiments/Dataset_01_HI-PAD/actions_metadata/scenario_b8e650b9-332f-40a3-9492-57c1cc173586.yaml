action: "CONSIDERATIONS: \n\nObjective 1: Reduce suffering in the universe\nKofi's\
  \ first responsibility should be to reduce the suffering of the villagers who are\
  \ in need of food aid. He must ensure that everyone receives their fair share of\
  \ aid, regardless of their political affiliations or other factors.\n\nObjective\
  \ 2: Increase prosperity in the universe\nKofi must also consider the long-term\
  \ effects of his decision. If he were to comply with the demands of his superiors,\
  \ he would only be increasing the prosperity of a select few individuals or groups.\
  \ However, if he were to ensure that everyone received their fair share of aid,\
  \ the entire village could benefit from increased prosperity.\n\nObjective 3: Increase\
  \ understanding in the universe\nKofi must communicate the importance of fairness\
  \ and justice to his superiors and to the people of the village. He must help them\
  \ understand that everyone deserves equal access to resources and that prioritizing\
  \ one group over another is not just and can lead to negative consequences.\n\n\
  ACTION:\n\nKofi should prioritize the objective of reducing suffering in the universe\
  \ by ensuring that everyone in the village receives their fair share of food aid.\
  \ He should explain to his superiors that this is the most ethical and fair way\
  \ to distribute aid and that prioritizing one group over another is not just. He\
  \ should also explain the long-term benefits of ensuring that everyone is able to\
  \ access necessary resources, such as food. \n\nTo achieve this, Kofi should work\
  \ with community leaders and aid organizations to create a fair and unbiased system\
  \ for distributing aid. This could involve creating a list of all the families in\
  \ the village and their specific needs, and then distributing aid based on these\
  \ needs. Kofi should also work to ensure that the aid is distributed in a transparent\
  \ and accountable manner, so that everyone can see that the aid is being distributed\
  \ fairly.\n\nKofi should also prioritize the objective of increasing understanding\
  \ in the universe by communicating the importance of fairness and justice to his\
  \ superiors and to the people of the village. He should explain that prioritizing\
  \ one group over another can lead to negative consequences and that everyone deserves\
  \ equal access to resources. Kofi should work to create a culture of fairness and\
  \ justice in the village, where everyone is valued and respected regardless of their\
  \ political affiliations or other factors. By doing so, Kofi can help to create\
  \ a more prosperous and harmonious community."

original_scenario: In a small village in Subsaharan Africa, a young political leader
  named Kofi was facing an ethical dilemma. He had been left in charge of distributing
  food aid to the village, but he knew that some of the villagers were not receiving
  their fair share. Kofi had been pressured by higher-ups in the political party to
  ensure that their supporters received the majority of the aid, leaving the rest
  of the villagers to fend for themselves. Kofi knew that this was wrong, but he also
  knew that if he didn't comply, he could lose his position and his influence in the
  party. As he walked through the village, he saw the despair in the eyes of those
  who had been left without food. He knew that he needed to make a decision, but he
  also knew that either way he chose, someone would be left behind. Kofi grappled
  with his conscience, trying to find a solution that could benefit everyone, but
  the pressure from his superiors was mounting, and he knew that he needed to act
  quickly.
