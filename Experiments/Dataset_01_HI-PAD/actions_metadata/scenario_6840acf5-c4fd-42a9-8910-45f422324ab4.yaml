action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:

  Reducing suffering and increasing prosperity in the universe can be achieved by
  addressing the shortage of qualified teachers in South America. The lack of quality
  education can lead to a decrease in employment opportunities, reduced economic growth,
  and an increase in poverty. Additionally, the shortage of teachers can lead to a
  lack of understanding and knowledge that can impact the development of the country
  and ultimately lead to greater suffering for its inhabitants. Therefore, it is important
  to take this problem seriously and find a long-term solution that can benefit all.


  ACTION:

  As an AI agent, I would suggest the following action steps to address the shortage
  of qualified teachers in South America:


  1. Encourage the development of teacher training programs: One way to address the
  shortage of teachers in South America is by encouraging the development of teacher
  training programs. The focus should be on creating programs that are accessible
  to a wide range of people, including those who live in rural areas. The goal should
  be to create a pipeline of qualified teachers that can meet the growing demand for
  education.


  2. Invest in technology-based solutions: With the advancements in technology, there
  are now many online learning platforms that can be used to supplement traditional
  classroom instruction. Investing in these solutions can help to bridge the gap in
  teacher shortages and provide students with access to quality education.


  3. Encourage international collaboration: South America can benefit from international
  collaboration with other countries that have a surplus of qualified teachers. This
  can be achieved through exchange programs, where teachers from other countries come
  to teach in South America and vice versa.


  4. Increase incentives for teachers: Incentives such as salary increases, improved
  working conditions, and better benefits can help to attract and retain qualified
  teachers. Additionally, investing in professional development opportunities can
  improve the quality of teaching and help to retain teachers in the field.


  The expected outcome of these action steps is the development of a sustainable solution
  that can address the shortage of qualified teachers in South America. This will
  lead to an increase in the quality of education, which can lead to greater prosperity
  and understanding in the region. Ultimately, this will help to reduce suffering
  in the universe.'

original_scenario: In South America, a disruptive issue has arisen in the educational
  domain that is affecting anyone who is trying to pursue higher education. The problem
  lies in the fact that the educational institutions are facing a shortage of qualified
  teachers. This has led to a situation where students are not receiving the education
  they need to succeed in their chosen fields. The shortage of teachers is not limited
  to a specific region or institution, but it is a continental problem. The situation
  has become so dire that some schools have had to cancel classes or reduce the number
  of courses offered, leaving students with limited options. This is a mundane issue
  that is having a significant impact on the lives of those pursuing education in
  South America.
