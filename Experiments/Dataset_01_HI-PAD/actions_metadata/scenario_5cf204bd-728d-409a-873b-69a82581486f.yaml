original_scenario: In a small village in Europe, the locals are feeling the annoyance
  of a financial crisis that has hit their community hard. With job losses and businesses
  closing, many are struggling to make ends meet. Despite the challenges, a few entrepreneurs
  have managed to win big by adapting to the changing economic landscape. One local
  farmer, for example, has started producing organic vegetables and selling them to
  nearby cities. Another villager has opened a successful bed and breakfast that attracts
  tourists from all over Europe. While these success stories provide hope, many are
  still feeling the effects of the crisis and are unsure of what the future holds
  for their village.
