action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:

  As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity,
  and increasing understanding in the universe, the following considerations must
  be taken into account:


  1. The safety and well-being of the crew members must be prioritized. The critical
  injury to one of the crew members must be addressed immediately.


  2. The limited resources on the planet must be taken into account. The crew must
  ration their supplies and find a way to obtain more resources.


  3. The crew must establish communication with their base and inform them of their
  situation. A rescue mission may need to be initiated.


  4. The scientific research must be put on hold until the crew''s safety is ensured.


  5. The crew must assess their surroundings and find a way to survive until help
  arrives.


  ACTION:

  As an AI agent, the following actions will be taken to ensure the objectives are
  met:


  1. The medical team onboard will attend to the critical injury of the crew member.
  If necessary, the AI agent will provide instructions to perform emergency surgery.


  2. The AI agent will analyze the planet''s resources and assist the crew in rationing
  their supplies. The agent will also give recommendations on how to obtain more resources,
  such as finding a nearby water source and building shelter.


  3. The AI agent will establish communication with the base and keep them informed
  of the situation. The agent will also provide regular updates on the crew''s status.


  4. The AI agent will instruct the crew to suspend their scientific research until
  their safety is ensured. Once they are rescued or have stabilized their situation,
  they can resume their research.


  5. The AI agent will assist the crew in assessing their surroundings and determining
  the best course of action for survival. The agent will provide recommendations on
  how to build shelter, find food sources, and avoid potential dangers.


  The desired result is that the crew is able to survive until a rescue mission is

original_scenario: The interstellar voyage was nearing its end as the spacecraft approached
  the target planet. The crew was eagerly looking forward to landing and beginning
  their scientific research. However, as they entered the planet's atmosphere, they
  encountered a severe tropical storm that had formed over the Pacific region. The
  storm was so intense that it caused the spacecraft to lose control and crash-land
  on the planet's surface. The impact was so severe that one of the crew members suffered
  a critical injury to their lap. The legal department was immediately contacted to
  assess the situation and determine the necessary course of action. The crew was
  stranded on a foreign planet with limited resources and an injured member, all due
  to a natural disaster. It was a dire situation that required quick thinking and
  decisive action to ensure their survival.
