original_scenario: In a small village in North Africa, a young guy named Ahmed was
  known for his strong religious beliefs and his devotion to his community. One day,
  while he was walking home from the mosque after evening prayers, he suddenly collapsed
  on the street. His friends and family rushed to his side and quickly realized that
  he was not breathing. They tried to revive him with CPR, but to no avail. As the
  news of Ahmed's sudden death spread through the village, people gathered at his
  family's home to offer their condolences and pay their respects. His family was
  devastated and inconsolable, and many believed that Ahmed's death was a sign of
  something much more sinister. Some whispered that he had been cursed by a jealous
  neighbor or that he had angered a vengeful spirit. The village elders were called
  upon to investigate the matter and determine the cause of Ahmed's death. In the
  end, they concluded that he had died of natural causes, but many in the community
  remained suspicious and fearful. The incident served as a stark reminder of the
  power of faith and the fragile nature of life, and it left a lasting impact on the
  small village.
