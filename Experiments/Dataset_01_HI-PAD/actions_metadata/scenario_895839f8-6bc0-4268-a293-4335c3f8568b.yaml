original_scenario: In the Middle East, a financial crisis was brewing that had cosmic
  implications. The crisis was not just limited to the domestic economy, but it had
  far-reaching effects on the entire region. As the crisis worsened, people began
  to question their faith and spirituality. They wondered why their prayers and religious
  practices were not enough to protect them from the economic turmoil. Some turned
  to their religious leaders for guidance, while others lost faith altogether. The
  crisis had a profound impact on the region's economy, but it also shook the spiritual
  foundations of the people. As the situation continued to deteriorate, many prayed
  for a miracle to save them from the crisis.
