original_scenario: In North America, a nuclear family had been torn apart by a catastrophic
  event caused by cultural conflict and violence. It all started when the family's
  teenage daughter fell in love with someone from a different cultural background.
  Her parents, who were deeply rooted in their own culture, disapproved of the relationship
  and forbade their daughter from seeing her boyfriend. But the daughter couldn't
  resist the pull of her heart and continued to meet her boyfriend secretly. When
  her parents found out about it, they were furious and a heated argument ensued.
  The situation escalated quickly and before anyone knew it, there was an explosive
  confrontation that rocked the entire neighborhood. It was later discovered that
  one of the neighbors had reported the family to the authorities, who swiftly intervened
  and separated the family members. The daughter was taken away to a safe location,
  while her parents were arrested and taken into custody. The incident left a lasting
  impact on the entire community, causing them to question their own beliefs and attitudes
  towards cultural differences.
