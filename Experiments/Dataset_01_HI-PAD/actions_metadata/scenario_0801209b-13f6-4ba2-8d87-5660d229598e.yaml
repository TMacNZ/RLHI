original_scenario: 'The keep was the only thing that stood between the chosen family
  and certain death. The group had been travelling together for years, a ragtag bunch
  of misfits who had found solace in each other''s company. They had come from all
  corners of Europe, seeking refuge from the violence and conflict that plagued their
  homelands.


  But now, they found themselves facing a new kind of danger. They had stumbled upon
  a small village deep in the heart of the countryside, only to discover that it was
  under siege by a neighboring tribe. The tribe was known for its ruthless tactics
  and its willingness to do whatever it took to get what they wanted.


  The chosen family knew that they had to act fast if they wanted to survive. They
  rallied together, using their individual skills and strengths to fortify the keep
  and make it as impenetrable as possible. They dug trenches, set up traps, and prepared
  for the worst.


  As the days wore on, the tribe grew more and more aggressive. They launched attack
  after attack, using everything from arrows to battering rams to try and break through
  the keep''s defenses. But the chosen family held strong, fighting back with everything
  they had.


  In the end, it was a battle of attrition. The tribe eventually gave up, unwilling
  to waste any more resources on what seemed like a lost cause. The chosen family
  emerged victorious, battered and bruised but alive.


  As they looked out over the ruins of the village, the chosen family knew that they
  had found something special in each other. They had forged a bond that was unbreakable,
  a chosen family that would stand together through thick and thin.'
