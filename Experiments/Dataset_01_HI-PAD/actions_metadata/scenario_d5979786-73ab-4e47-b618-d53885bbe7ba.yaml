  \ drugs to compete would be unfair to those who choose not to use them, and could\

  \ Hosting an Olympic qualifying event is a great opportunity to showcase the village\

original_scenario: The small village of Tamazirt in North Africa had been chosen to
  host the Olympic qualifying trials for its region. The excitement was palpable as
  athletes from all over North Africa descended on the village to compete in events
  ranging from track and field to swimming. However, an ethical dilemma soon emerged.
  It was discovered that some of the athletes had been using performance-enhancing
  drugs to improve their chances of winning. The village officials were faced with
  a legal dilemma - if they disqualified the athletes, it could lead to protests and
  even riots in the village. On the other hand, if they turned a blind eye to the
  drug use, it would contradict the Olympic spirit of fair play and equal opportunity.
  The officials were torn between wanting to showcase their village and wanting to
  uphold the principles of the Olympic Games. In the end, they decided to disqualify
  the athletes using drugs and risked the potential backlash. The decision was met
  with mixed reactions, but ultimately, the Olympic spirit prevailed, and the village
  held a successful qualifying event.
