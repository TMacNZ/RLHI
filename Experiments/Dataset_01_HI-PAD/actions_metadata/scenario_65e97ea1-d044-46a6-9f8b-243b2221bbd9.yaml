  \ I will work with local authorities and organizations to provide long-term support\
  \ to the village. This can include rebuilding homes and infrastructure, providing\
  \ education and job training opportunities, and supporting economic development\
  \ in the area. By investing in the long-term prosperity of the village, we can help\

original_scenario: In a remote South Asian village, the night sky was illuminated
  with a blinding, intergalactic light show. What was once thought to be a rare meteor
  shower quickly turned into a life-threatening natural disaster as the meteors began
  to rain down on the village. The cultural significance of the night sky was not
  lost on the villagers as they watched in horror as their homes and way of life were
  destroyed. The intergalactic storm was unlike anything they had ever experienced,
  but they knew they had to act fast to survive. As they scrambled for cover, they
  prayed for the safety of their loved ones and wondered if they would ever see the
  stars in the night sky again.
