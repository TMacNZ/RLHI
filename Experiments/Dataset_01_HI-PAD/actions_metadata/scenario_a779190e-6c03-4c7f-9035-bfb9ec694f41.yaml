action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering: Anxiety, stress, and mental health issues caused by the online
  examination are causing significant suffering to students. We need to ensure that
  students are not put through such traumatic experiences.


  Increasing prosperity: Education is a means to prosperity, and students need to
  be able to learn, grow, and excel without any impediments. The online examination
  is proving to be a significant obstacle to this.


  Increasing understanding: The online examination has highlighted the technological
  and infrastructural challenges that students and teachers face in the region. We
  need to understand these challenges better to improve the online learning experience.


  ACTION:


  To alleviate the suffering caused by the online examination, I will collaborate
  with schools and universities in South Asia to create a more student-friendly online
  examination experience. This includes the following:


  1. Conduct a survey: I will conduct a survey among students to understand their
  online examination experience better. The survey will cover topics such as internet
  connectivity, technical glitches, the difficulty of the exam, and mental health
  issues.


  2. Develop guidelines: Based on the survey results, I will work with schools and
  universities to develop guidelines for a more student-friendly online examination
  experience. These guidelines will include measures to ensure that technical glitches
  do not affect the students'' progress, as well as provisions for students with mental
  health issues.


  3. Provide technical support: I will work with schools and universities to provide
  technical support to students during the examination. This includes a helpline that
  students can call in case of technical issues.


  4. Raise awareness: I will collaborate with schools and universities to raise awareness
  among students about the online examination experience. This includes educating
  them about the technical requirements for the examination and providing tips for
  better concentration.


  By taking these actions, we can ensure that the online examination experience is
  more student-friendly and less traumatic. This will not only reduce suffering but
  also increase prosperity by ensuring that students can learn and grow without any
  impediments. Additionally, by understanding the challenges that students and teachers
  face, we can improve the online learning experience in general.'

original_scenario: 'As the pandemic raged on, schools and universities across South
  Asia shifted to online learning. While this allowed for some semblance of normalcy,
  it also brought its own set of challenges. One such challenge was the online examination.


  For students, the online examination was a source of immense anxiety. The fear of
  the internet connection dropping, the possibility of technical glitches, and the
  inability to ask for help in person all made for a stressful experience. And for
  some, the stakes were even higher. Students who relied on good grades to secure
  their future, or those who were already struggling with mental health issues, found
  the online examination to be catastrophic.


  As the day of the examination approached, social media was flooded with posts from
  students expressing their fears and frustrations. Many shared stories of their internet
  connection dropping midway through the test or their computer crashing, causing
  them to lose all their progress. Others talked about how difficult it was to concentrate
  at home, with family members and roommates constantly moving around and causing
  distractions.


  The emotional toll of the online examination was not limited to just the students.
  Teachers too felt the weight of the situation. They had to deal with the added pressure
  of ensuring that the online examination was fair and unbiased, while also being
  empathetic to the students'' struggles.


  As the examination came to an end, there was a collective sigh of relief from students
  and teachers alike. But the emotional scars left behind by this experience would
  take a long time to heal. It was clear that while online learning had its benefits,
  there was still a long way to go before it could replace the traditional classroom
  experience.'
