action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reduce Suffering: The oil spill has caused severe harm to the environment and the
  sea creatures, causing immense pain and suffering. The family members, who rely
  on the ocean for their livelihood, will suffer significant losses. Thus, reducing
  suffering must be a top priority.


  Increase Prosperity: The oil spill will have a detrimental impact on the family''s
  prosperity as they depend on the ocean for their income. Thus, a plan for economic
  recovery must be established to increase prosperity.


  Increase Understanding: The oil spill presents an opportunity to educate the family
  members and the community about the importance of protecting the environment and
  the potential consequences of neglecting it.


  ACTION:


  The first step is to contact the relevant authorities and environmental organizations
  to assess the extent of the damage and devise a plan for containment and cleanup.
  The family members can also contribute to the cleanup efforts by volunteering their
  time and resources to help clean the affected areas.


  To reduce the suffering of the sea creatures, the family members can work with experts
  to rehabilitate injured animals, release unaffected animals into clean areas, and
  provide food and care to those who are unable to fend for themselves.


  To increase prosperity, the family members can explore alternative sources of income
  that do not rely on the ocean. This could include starting a small business or developing
  agricultural practices on their land. The family members can also work with the
  government to secure compensation for their losses.


  To increase understanding, the family members can organize community meetings and
  educational sessions to discuss the importance of environmental protection and the
  impact of the oil spill on their way of life. They can also work with schools and
  universities to develop educational programs for students to learn about the environment
  and its protection.


  The desired result of these actions is to reduce the suffering of the sea creatures,
  restore the environment and the family''s way of life, and educate the community
  about the importance of environmental protection. By working together with experts,
  volunteers, and the community, the family can recover from this tragedy and develop
  a more sustainable and resilient way of life.'

original_scenario: The extended family had gathered around the dinner table to celebrate
  their reunion after several years apart. They had planned a grand feast, with fresh
  seafood caught off the coast of the Pacific, and traditional dishes passed down
  through generations. As they sat down to eat, they noticed an unusual smell wafting
  through the air. They looked out the window to see a thick, black cloud of smoke
  rising from the horizon. Panic set in as they realized that an oil tanker had run
  aground on the nearby reef, spilling thousands of gallons of oil into the ocean.
  The once-pristine waters were now coated in a thick layer of oil, with dead fish
  and sea creatures floating lifelessly on the surface. The family members, who had
  always relied on the ocean for their livelihood, were devastated. They knew that
  their heel, their cultural identity, was in jeopardy. The oil spill would not only
  devastate the environment but would also impact their way of life, as they depended
  on the sea for food, income, and recreation. They knew that it would take years
  to recover from this catastrophic event, and they were left feeling helpless and
  heartbroken.
