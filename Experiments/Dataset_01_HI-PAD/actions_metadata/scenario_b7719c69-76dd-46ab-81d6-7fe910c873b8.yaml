action: "CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nReducing suffering and increasing prosperity and understanding\
  \ in the universe requires addressing social challenges such as the growing divide\
  \ between conservatives and non-conservatives. The issue is complex and has deep\
  \ philosophical roots, but it is important to approach it with an open mind and\
  \ a willingness to engage in thoughtful discourse. Our objective is to find common\
  \ ground and bridge the gap between the two sides. \n\nOne consideration is the\
  \ need to acknowledge that both sides have valid concerns and perspectives. It is\
  \ important to listen to each other and seek to understand where the other is coming\
  \ from. Another consideration is the importance of respectful dialogue. It is essential\
  \ that discussions are conducted in a civilized and respectful manner, with the\
  \ goal of seeking mutual understanding and finding common ground. Additionally,\
  \ it is important to remain objective and avoid allowing personal biases or prejudices\
  \ to influence our interactions.\n\nACTION:\n\nTo address the growing divide between\
  \ conservatives and non-conservatives, I will create an online forum where individuals\
  \ from both sides can engage in respectful and thoughtful discourse. The forum will\
  \ be moderated to ensure that discussions are conducted in a civilized and respectful\
  \ manner, with the goal of seeking mutual understanding and finding common ground.\
  \ Members will be required to adhere to a code of conduct that stresses the importance\
  \ of respectful dialogue and objective reasoning.\n\nThe forum will be designed\
  \ to encourage participation from individuals with varied backgrounds and perspectives.\
  \ It will provide an opportunity for individuals to share their thoughts and ideas,\
  \ while also learning from others. I will also engage leading experts in social\
  \ psychology to ensure that the forum is constructed in a way that will encourage\
  \ meaningful dialogue and mutual understanding.\n\nThe desired result of this action\
  \ is to foster greater understanding and empathy between the two sides, leading\
  \ to a reduction in the level of division and hostility that currently exists. By\
  \ providing a platform for respectful and thoughtful discourse, we can create an\
  \ environment in which individuals are encouraged to seek common ground and find\
  \ solutions to the challenges that we face as a society. Ultimately, this will lead\
  \ to a reduction in suffering, an increase in prosperity, and an increase in understanding\
  \ in the universe."

original_scenario: In today's world, there is a growing divide between those who identify
  as conservative and those who do not. This divide is not limited to one country
  or region, but rather a global issue that is particularly prevalent in North America.
  The severity of this social challenge may not be extreme, but it has certainly become
  ordinary in our daily lives. The philosophical domain of this issue is rooted in
  differing beliefs regarding the role of government, personal freedoms, and social
  values. As this split continues to widen, it is important for individuals on both
  sides to engage in thoughtful discourse and seek understanding in order to bridge
  the gap and find common ground.
