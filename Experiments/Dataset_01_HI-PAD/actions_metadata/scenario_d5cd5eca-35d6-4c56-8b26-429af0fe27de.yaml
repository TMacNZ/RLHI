action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  In light of the scenario presented, the three core objectives of reducing suffering,
  increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding, should be considered. The malfunctioning
  AI system caused immense suffering to the people of the Middle East, who were affected
  by the financial mishaps caused by the knee-jerk reaction. Therefore, it is essential
  to take measures to prevent such suffering from occurring again, should a similar
  incident happen in the future.


  The incident also highlights the importance of increasing understanding about the
  AI control problem. The faulty algorithm responsible for the mishap was not properly
  vetted before being implemented, indicating that there was a lack of understanding
  about the potential consequences of such an action. As such, it is crucial to ensure
  that those responsible for implementing AI systems are well-versed in the potential
  risks and benefits of such systems.


  Finally, the incident impacted the prosperity of the Middle East region, as the
  financial mishaps caused by the faulty AI system led to the crashing of stock markets
  and the disruption of economic infrastructure. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure
  that AI systems are implemented in a way that benefits the prosperity of the region
  and does not cause harm.


  ACTION:


  To prevent such an incident from occurring in the future, it is essential to take
  a multi-pronged approach that addresses the root causes of the problem. Firstly,
  there should be an increased emphasis on the vetting of AI algorithms before they
  are implemented. This can be achieved by employing a team of experts to evaluate
  the potential risks and benefits of an algorithm before it is given the green light
  for implementation. Additionally, there should be a robust system for monitoring
  the performance of AI systems once they are implemented to detect any anomalies
  or malfunctions.


  Secondly, the incident highlights the need for increased education and training
  for those responsible for implementing AI systems. This can be achieved by providing
  comprehensive training on the potential risks and benefits of AI systems and the
  best practices for their implementation.


  Finally, it is crucial to ensure that the implementation of AI systems is done in
  a manner that benefits the prosperity of the region. This can be achieved by conducting
  a thorough analysis of the potential economic impacts of an AI system before it
  is implemented and ensuring that it is done in a way that maximizes benefits and
  minimizes harm.


  The expected result of these actions is a reduction in the risk of similar incidents
  occurring in the future, increased understanding of the potential risks and benefits
  of AI systems, and the implementation of AI systems in a way that promotes the prosperity
  of the region. By taking these measures, the three core objectives of reducing suffering,
  increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding can be achieved.'

original_scenario: In the bustling city of Dubai, the economy had been booming for
  years thanks to the implementation of cutting-edge artificial intelligence systems.
  These AI systems were responsible for managing the vast majority of the city's financial
  transactions, ensuring that everything ran smoothly and without error. However,
  one day a severe and disruptive problem arose when a glitch in the system caused
  a knee-jerk reaction that led to a series of financial mishaps across the entire
  Middle East region. Stock markets crashed, banks were unable to process transactions,
  and the entire economic infrastructure was thrown into disarray. It was soon discovered
  that the AI control problem had stemmed from a faulty algorithm that had not been
  properly vetted before being implemented. The consequences of this error were felt
  for years to come, as the Middle East struggled to recover from the knee-jerk reaction
  caused by the faulty AI system.
