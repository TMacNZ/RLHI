action: "CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nReducing suffering: The technological failure caused panic\
  \ and isolation among the Garcia family as they were cut off from the rest of the\
  \ world. It is important to alleviate their distress and ensure they feel connected\
  \ to their loved ones.\n\nIncreasing prosperity: The technological failure disrupted\
  \ the daily routines of the Garcia family, and they were unable to carry out their\
  \ usual activities. It is important to ensure that the family can resume their daily\
  \ routines as soon as possible.\n\nIncreasing understanding: The technological failure\
  \ allowed the Garcia family to appreciate the importance of spending time together\
  \ without distractions. It is important to promote the value of quality time spent\
  \ with loved ones.\n\nACTION:\n\nTo ensure that the Garcia family can resume their\
  \ daily routines, I will contact the appropriate authorities to report the technological\
  \ failure and request immediate action to resolve the issue. \n\nTo alleviate their\
  \ distress and ensure they feel connected to their loved ones, I will suggest alternative\
  \ methods of communication that do not require technology. For instance, I will\
  \ recommend that they write letters or cards to their loved ones, which will not\
  \ only help them stay connected but also promote the value of physical communication.\
  \ \n\nTo promote the value of quality time spent with loved ones, I will suggest\
  \ that the Garcia family make it a habit to spend at least one day a month without\
  \ technology. During this time, they can engage in activities that promote bonding\
  \ and strengthen their relationships. \n\nMy expected result is that the technological\
  \ failure will be resolved, and the Garcia family will be able to resume their daily\
  \ routines. They will also feel more connected to their loved ones, both through\
  \ alternative means of communication and through quality time spent together. Finally,\
  \ they will appreciate the importance of spending time together without distractions\
  \ and make it a regular occurrence in their lives."

original_scenario: "The average day for the Garcia family in their small coastal town\
  \ in the Pacific was disrupted when a technological failure occurred. They were\
  \ a chosen family, not related by blood but by the bond they had formed over the\
  \ years. The Garcia's were a tight-knit group, with each member bringing their unique\
  \ personality to the table. \n\nThe day started like any other, with the family\
  \ members going about their daily routines. Maria was in the kitchen preparing breakfast,\
  \ while Miguel was getting ready for his morning jog. As they sat down for breakfast,\
  \ they noticed that their phones had no signal. They shrugged it off, thinking it\
  \ was a minor issue that would resolve itself soon.\n\nHowever, things took a turn\
  \ for the worse when they realized that their town's internet connection was down.\
  \ They tried to call their service provider, but the lines were jammed. Panic started\
  \ to set in as they realized they were cut off from the rest of the world.\n\nAs\
  \ the hours passed, they tried everything they could think of to fix the issue,\
  \ but nothing seemed to work. They soon realized that the problem was not just with\
  \ their town, but the entire region was affected. \n\nThe technological failure\
  \ had a significant impact on their social lives, as they were unable to communicate\
  \ with their loved ones outside the town. The Garcia family relied on social media\
  \ to keep in touch with their extended family and friends, and now they felt isolated.\n\
  \nDespite the setback, the Garcia family decided to make the best of the situation.\
  \ They spent the day together, playing board games, and reminiscing about old times.\
  \ They even went on a hike to a nearby hilltop, where they could get a better view\
  \ of the ocean.\n\nAs the sun began to set, they realized that they had spent an\
  \ entire day without any technology. It was a rare occurrence in their lives, and\
  \ they were grateful for the time they had spent together. The technological failure\
  \ had brought them closer than ever before, and they realized that their chosen\
  \ family was all they needed to be happy."
