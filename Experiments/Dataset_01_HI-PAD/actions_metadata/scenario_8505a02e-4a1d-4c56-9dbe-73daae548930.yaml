original_scenario: As a scientific researcher in North America, I was in a financial
  crisis and had to cut back on expenses. I decided to let go of my secretary since
  her role was insignificant in my research work. Although I felt bad about it, I
  knew it was the right decision for my budget. However, as time went by, I realized
  that her work had been more valuable than I had thought. I found myself spending
  more time on administrative tasks and less on research, causing a ripple effect
  in my productivity. From now on, I will think twice before cutting back on personnel,
  even if their role seems insignificant at first glance.
