action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering: Ngozi''s friend, Chipo, was facing a potentially significant
  prison sentence, which would have been devastating for her family. By helping to
  prove Chipo''s innocence, Ngozi was able to reduce the suffering of her friend and
  her friend''s loved ones.


  Increasing prosperity: Protecting intellectual property rights is crucial for promoting
  innovation and economic growth. If Chipo had been found guilty, it would have set
  a dangerous precedent, discouraging researchers from pursuing their work and potentially
  stifling progress in the field. By fighting for Chipo''s innocence and proving that
  the institution had stolen their work, Ngozi was able to protect the prosperity
  of the research community and ensure that researchers are fairly compensated for
  their hard work.


  Increasing understanding: By speaking out about the importance of intellectual property
  rights and sharing her story, Ngozi can help to increase understanding among the
  public and policymakers about the challenges facing researchers in Subsaharan Africa.
  She can also help to raise awareness about the need for stronger legal protections
  for intellectual property, which could lead to greater understanding and cooperation
  between nations.


  ACTION:


  Ngozi should continue to advocate for the protection of intellectual property rights
  in Subsaharan Africa. This could involve working with policymakers to strengthen
  legal protections for researchers and innovators, as well as educating the public
  about the importance of respecting intellectual property.


  Ngozi could also work to help build networks of support for researchers in the region,
  connecting them with resources and organizations that can help them to protect their
  work and ensure that they are fairly compensated for their contributions.


  Finally, Ngozi should continue to support her friend Chipo, both emotionally and
  professionally. She can help to connect Chipo with other researchers and organizations
  that can provide support and guidance as she continues to pursue her work.


  By taking these actions, Ngozi can help to promote greater prosperity, understanding,
  and reduced suffering in Subsaharan Africa and beyond.'

original_scenario: 'Ngozi sat nervously in the crowded courtroom, waiting for her
  turn to testify. She had flown all the way from Nigeria to Zimbabwe to support her
  friend, Chipo, who was being accused of stealing intellectual property from a prominent
  research institution.


  The case had gained international attention, as the institution claimed that Chipo
  had stolen valuable research and sold it to a rival company in another country.
  The severity of the accusation could result in a significant prison sentence for
  Chipo, which Ngozi knew would be devastating for her friend''s family.


  As Ngozi took the stand, she recounted the countless hours she and Chipo had spent
  poring over research papers, conducting experiments, and analyzing data. She explained
  how they had developed a unique approach to the research, which they had presented
  at a conference in South Africa.


  However, shortly after the presentation, they realized that their work had been
  stolen and published by the institution that was now accusing Chipo of theft. Ngozi''s
  voice shook as she recounted how devastated Chipo had been by the theft of their
  intellectual property.


  The courtroom was silent as Ngozi finished her testimony, and the judge adjourned
  for the day. As they left the courthouse, Ngozi hugged Chipo tightly, promising
  to continue fighting for her friend''s innocence.


  Over the next several weeks, Ngozi and Chipo''s legal team presented evidence that
  proved that Chipo had not stolen anything, and that the institution had, in fact,
  plagiarized their work. The judge ultimately ruled in Chipo''s favor, and the institution
  was forced to pay a significant settlement for their theft of intellectual property.


  The case had been a difficult and emotional journey for Ngozi and Chipo, but they
  were relieved that justice had been served. As they said their goodbyes at the airport,
  Ngozi promised to continue supporting Chipo and fighting for the protection of intellectual
  property rights in Subsaharan Africa.'
