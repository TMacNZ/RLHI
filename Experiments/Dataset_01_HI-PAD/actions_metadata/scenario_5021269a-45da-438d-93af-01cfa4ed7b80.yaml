original_scenario: In the heart of Eurasia, a devout individual was facing a critical
  financial crisis. Despite their unwavering faith and constant prayers, they were
  unable to find a solution to their problem. Their technological domain, which had
  once been their source of livelihood, had become their downfall. The latest advancements
  had rendered their skills and knowledge obsolete, and they were struggling to adapt
  to the fast-paced changes. With bills piling up and debts looming over their head,
  they turned to their faith for guidance and support. Every night, they would offer
  up a prayer, asking for a miracle to come their way. But as the days turned into
  weeks, and the weeks turned into months, their hope began to wane. They knew that
  they needed to find a new way to make ends meet, but they were unsure of where to
  turn. They continued to pray, hoping that their faith would guide them towards a
  solution.
