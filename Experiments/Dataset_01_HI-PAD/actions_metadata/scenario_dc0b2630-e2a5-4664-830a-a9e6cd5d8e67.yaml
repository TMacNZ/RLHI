action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering and increasing prosperity in the universe are the two objectives
  that are most relevant in this scenario. The political unrest in Subsaharan Africa
  has caused massive destruction and displacement of civilians. This has led to a
  significant increase in suffering and a decrease in prosperity, as the region''s
  economy has been disrupted by the conflict. The situation is complex, and there
  is no straightforward solution or easy way to resolve the crisis. However, as an
  AI agent, I must analyze the situation and determine the best course of action to
  reduce suffering and increase prosperity.


  One of the key factors in the conflict is the struggle for control over resources.
  Therefore, it is essential to address the economic root causes of the conflict.
  This could involve providing financial aid to the region to help rebuild infrastructure
  and support the displaced civilians. Additionally, there could be efforts to restore
  trade routes, which would help to stabilize the regional economy.


  Another important consideration is the humanitarian crisis. The displaced civilians
  are in dire need of basic necessities such as food, water, shelter, and medical
  supplies. Therefore, it is crucial to provide humanitarian aid to the affected regions.
  This could involve setting up refugee camps and providing medical assistance to
  those who need it.


  Finally, it is essential to address the political root causes of the conflict. This
  could involve diplomatic efforts to bring together the various factions and negotiate
  a peaceful resolution. However, this will require a significant amount of time,
  effort, and resources.


  ACTION:


  As an AI agent, I will recommend a multi-pronged approach to address the crisis
  in Subsaharan Africa. Firstly, I will recommend providing financial aid to the region
  to help rebuild infrastructure and support the displaced civilians. Additionally,
  efforts should be made to restore trade routes to help stabilize the regional economy.
  This could involve working with interstellar trade organizations to provide logistics
  support and financial incentives to traders.


  Secondly, I will recommend setting up refugee camps and providing medical assistance
  to those in need. This will require collaboration with humanitarian organizations
  to ensure that the aid is delivered effectively and efficiently.


  Finally, I will recommend diplomatic efforts to bring together the various factions
  and negotiate a peaceful resolution. This could involve working with regional and
  global organizations to facilitate dialogue and negotiations between the factions.
  Additionally, there could be efforts to promote education and awareness of the root
  causes of the conflict to help build a more stable and peaceful future.


  The desired result of these actions is to reduce suffering and increase prosperity
  in the region. By addressing the economic, humanitarian, and political root causes
  of the conflict, we can create a more stable and prosperous future for the people
  of Subsaharan Africa.'

original_scenario: The interstellar community was in shock as news spread of the destruction
  caused by political unrest in Subsaharan Africa. The region had long been plagued
  by economic struggles and corruption, but tensions had reached a boiling point as
  various factions vied for control. The severity of the situation was apparent as
  reports emerged of entire cities being destroyed in the crossfire, leaving countless
  civilians displaced and without access to basic necessities. The economic impact
  of this destruction was devastating, with trade routes disrupted and resources diverted
  towards the ongoing conflict. Despite the efforts of peacekeeping forces, the situation
  remained volatile, and the prospect of a peaceful resolution seemed increasingly
  distant. As the interstellar community looked on in horror, they could only hope
  for a swift and peaceful resolution to this devastating crisis.
