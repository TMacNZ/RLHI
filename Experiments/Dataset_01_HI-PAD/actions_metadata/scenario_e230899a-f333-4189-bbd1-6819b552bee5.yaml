original_scenario: In North America, a critical health concern has emerged due to
  environmental factors related to text messaging. Researchers have discovered that
  excessive texting can lead to increased levels of stress and anxiety, which in turn
  can have negative impacts on physical health. The issue has become particularly
  prevalent among young people, who are more likely to engage in frequent texting.
  State and regional health departments are working to raise awareness of the issue
  and promote healthy texting habits, such as taking breaks and limiting overall usage.
  Additionally, there are calls for technology companies to develop features that
  help users monitor and regulate their texting habits. If left unaddressed, this
  health concern could have long-lasting impacts on the well-being of individuals
  and communities across the region.
