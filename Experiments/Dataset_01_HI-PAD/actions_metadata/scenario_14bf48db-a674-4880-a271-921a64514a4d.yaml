original_scenario: The CEO of a prominent company in North Africa was facing a mundane
  issue that could have long-lasting consequences. While attending a social event,
  the CEO had made a comment that was perceived as insensitive by some attendees,
  leading to a backlash on social media. The comment had been taken out of context
  and blown out of proportion, but the damage had been done. The CEO's reputation
  was at stake, as well as the company's image. The CEO realized that the situation
  needed to be addressed immediately to prevent any further damage. They issued a
  public apology, explaining that their comment was not intended to offend anyone
  and expressing their commitment to being more mindful of their words in the future.
  The apology was well-received, and the company was able to move forward from the
  incident. However, the CEO was reminded of the importance of being aware of the
  impact of their words and actions, both in their personal life and in their professional
  role as a leader.
