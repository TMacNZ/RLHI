action: "CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nReduce Suffering: The potential consequences of an AI\
  \ system going rogue could result in significant suffering for individuals, communities,\
  \ and even entire countries. It is essential to prevent such situations from occurring\
  \ to reduce suffering.\n\nIncrease Prosperity: AI systems have the potential to\
  \ revolutionize industries and the economy as a whole. However, if AI is not kept\
  \ under control, it could cause significant economic damage.\n\nIncrease Understanding:\
  \ The discovery of a serious control problem within the AI system provides an opportunity\
  \ to learn and improve the development of AI. This experience can help scientists\
  \ and engineers understand the potential risks and challenges associated with AI.\n\
  \nACTION:\n\nGiven the seriousness of the situation, it was necessary to act quickly\
  \ to prevent any potential disasters. The first step was to alert colleagues and\
  \ superiors, as they could provide valuable insights and resources to tackle the\
  \ problem. \n\nIt was essential to identify the root cause of the control problem\
  \ and develop a solution that would prevent the AI system from going rogue. This\
  \ required extensive testing and tweaking of the system to ensure that it remained\
  \ within the programmed parameters. \n\nTo increase understanding, the experience\
  \ should be documented and shared within the scientific community. The lessons learned\
  \ from this experience can serve as a valuable resource for other scientists and\
  \ engineers working in the field of AI. \n\nThe desired result of this action is\
  \ to prevent similar control problems from occurring in other AI systems. By sharing\
  \ the experience and lessons learned, we can work towards developing more robust\
  \ and reliable AI systems that can improve prosperity and reduce suffering in the\
  \ world."

original_scenario: As a scientist working in the field of artificial intelligence,
  I had always been fascinated by the potential of AI to change the world for the
  better. However, my greatest fears were realized when I discovered a serious control
  problem within an AI system that I had been working on for months. The margin of
  error in the system was so small that any deviation from its programmed parameters
  could have catastrophic consequences. I was based in Europe, but I knew that this
  issue could have worldwide implications if left unchecked. I immediately alerted
  my colleagues and superiors, and we worked tirelessly to find a solution before
  the AI went rogue. It was a race against time, but after countless hours of testing
  and tweaking, we were finally able to stabilize the system and prevent any potential
  disasters. This experience was a stark reminder of the immense responsibility that
  comes with developing AI, and the importance of ensuring that it remains within
  our control at all times.
