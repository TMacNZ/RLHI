original_scenario: "Dr. Adesuwa had been practicing medicine in Subsaharan Africa\
  \ for over a decade, and had seen it all. But the combination of symptoms that her\
  \ patient, Aminata, was experiencing had her stumped. Aminata had been complaining\
  \ of a persistent headache and fatigue for weeks, which were accompanied by joint\
  \ pain and a mild fever. Dr. Adesuwa had run all the routine tests, but everything\
  \ had come back normal. \n\nAs a seasoned physician, Dr. Adesuwa knew that sometimes\
  \ the most obscure health concerns could have serious consequences. She decided\
  \ to take a closer look at Aminata's medical history, and found out that her patient\
  \ had recently started taking a new herbal supplement. Dr. Adesuwa was aware that\
  \ many of the herbal supplements sold in the region were not regulated, and sometimes\
  \ contained harmful substances. \n\nShe asked Aminata to bring in the supplement,\
  \ and sent it off to the lab for testing. The results came back positive for a combination\
  \ of toxic compounds, which were causing the symptoms that Aminata was experiencing.\
  \ Dr. Adesuwa immediately advised her patient to stop taking the supplement, and\
  \ prescribed some medication to alleviate her symptoms. \n\nA few weeks later, Aminata\
  \ returned to Dr. Adesuwa's clinic, feeling much better. She thanked the doctor\
  \ for her persistence, and for uncovering the root cause of her health concerns.\
  \ Dr. Adesuwa felt a sense of relief, knowing that she had made a difference in\
  \ her patient's life. She made a mental note to always take a closer look at her\
  \ patient's medical history, and to never underestimate the potential dangers of\
  \ unregulated herbal supplements."
