original_scenario: As a philosophy student traveling to North Africa to study ancient
  texts, I had a clear agenda. But my plans were thrown off course when I was approached
  by a dangerous individual. He demanded that I hand over my notes and threatened
  me with a knife. I hesitated, trying to think of a way out of the situation. Suddenly,
  a group of locals came to my rescue and chased the man away. Shaken, I realized
  that my philosophical studies had not prepared me for the mundanity of danger in
  the real world. From that moment on, I had a new perspective on the importance of
  personal safety and the role of philosophy in shaping our understanding of the world.
