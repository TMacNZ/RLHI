original_scenario: 'In the year 3019, humanity had colonized several planets in the
  galaxy, but their space exploration efforts had led them to a planet called Zorax.
  Zorax was a beautiful planet in the North African region, with lush forests, blue
  skies, and sparkling rivers. It was a perfect place to establish a new civilization,
  and the humans were excited to start their new lives on this planet.


  However, they soon realized that Zorax was a planet prone to natural disasters.
  The first disaster that struck was a massive earthquake that shook the entire planet,
  leaving the humans shaken and terrified. They had never experienced anything like
  this before, and they didn''t know how to deal with it. The earthquake lasted for
  several days and caused massive destruction, leaving the humans to pick up the pieces
  and rebuild their homes and communities.


  But the worst was yet to come. A few months after the earthquake, a massive storm
  hit the planet, with winds so strong that they uprooted trees and destroyed buildings.
  The storm lasted for weeks, and the humans were forced to take shelter in underground
  bunkers to survive. The storm caused long-lasting damage to the planet, and it would
  take years for the humans to recover from it.


  Despite the challenges, the humans on Zorax tried to find humor in their situation.
  They started organizing comedy shows to lighten the mood and bring some joy to their
  lives. Even in the darkest of times, they found a way to laugh and connect with
  each other.


  As the humans on Zorax struggled to rebuild their homes and communities, they began
  to question the nature of their existence. They wondered why they had chosen to
  leave their home planet and venture into the unknown. They pondered the philosophical
  questions of life, and some even began to question their own mortality.


  Despite the natural disasters that had struck their planet, the humans on Zorax
  refused to give up. They were determined to rebuild their civilization and make
  a new home for themselves on this beautiful planet. And as they worked together
  to overcome the challenges they faced, they found a deeper sense of connection and
  purpose.'
