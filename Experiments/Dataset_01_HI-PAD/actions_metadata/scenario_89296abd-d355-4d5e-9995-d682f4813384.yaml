original_scenario: It was the anniversary of their chosen family's founding, and they
  had planned a big celebration. However, they were hit by a disruptive financial
  crisis that was impacting the entire Middle East region. They had invested heavily
  in technological startups, but with the crisis, their investments were plummeting
  in value. The chosen family had to come together and make some tough decisions about
  their finances. They had to cut back on the anniversary celebration and focus on
  finding a solution to their financial woes. They knew that their technological investments
  were still valuable in the long run, but they needed to find a way to weather the
  storm in the short term. They decided to pool their resources and invest in more
  stable areas like real estate and commodities. It was a difficult time, but their
  chosen family's bond and commitment to each other helped them get through it. They
  emerged from the crisis stronger and more resilient than ever, ready to face any
  challenge that came their way.
