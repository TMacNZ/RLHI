original_scenario: 'The heat was oppressive as Farid made his way through the crowded
  marketplace, his eyes darting from stall to stall. He was on a mission to find the
  perfect gift for his daughter, Leila''s, 10th birthday. As he scanned the various
  trinkets and treasures, his mind wandered, lost in thought.


  Suddenly, a loud explosion rocked the marketplace, sending Farid and the other shoppers
  scattering in all directions. Chaos erupted as smoke filled the air and debris rained
  down from above. Farid''s heart pounded in his chest as he realized the severity
  of the situation. He had to find Leila.


  Pushing his way through the panicked crowd, Farid''s imagination ran wild with all
  the terrible possibilities. Had Leila been caught in the blast? Was she hurt? These
  thoughts only fueled his determination to find her.


  After what felt like an eternity, Farid finally spotted his daughter, huddled under
  a table with a few other frightened children. Relief flooded through him as he rushed
  over to her, scooping her up in his arms.


  As they made their way out of the marketplace, Farid couldn''t shake the feeling
  of unease. The incident had been long-lasting, with the effects of the explosion
  reverberating throughout the region for weeks to come. The physical scars left behind
  were a constant reminder of the danger that lurked in the world around them.


  But despite the lasting impact of the accident, Farid couldn''t help but feel grateful
  for his daughter''s safety. His imagination had taken him to some dark places, but
  in the end, they had made it out alive. And for that, he would forever be thankful.'
