original_scenario: The extended family had been planning their Pacific island vacation
  for months, but as they arrived at their destination, they were met with a catastrophic
  environmental issue. The turquoise waters were littered with plastic bags, which
  not only ruined the scenery but also posed a severe threat to the marine life. The
  family was devastated, as they had been looking forward to swimming, snorkeling,
  and exploring the vibrant coral reefs. The situation was dire, and they realized
  they had to act fast to prevent further damage. The family decided to organize a
  beach cleanup, urging other tourists to join them. They spent their days collecting
  bags and other debris, filling up multiple trash bags, and disposing of them properly.
  Although it was a challenging and daunting task, they were determined to make a
  difference and help restore the beauty of the island.
