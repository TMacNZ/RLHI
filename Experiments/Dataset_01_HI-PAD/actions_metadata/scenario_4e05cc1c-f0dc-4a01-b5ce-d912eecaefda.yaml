action: 'CONSIDERATIONS:


  Reducing suffering: The conflict within the Tui family was causing emotional distress
  and could have potentially caused long-term damage to family relationships. It was
  important to find a solution that would reduce the suffering caused by the conflict.


  Increasing prosperity: The conflict over finances could have had a negative impact
  on the family''s financial stability. It was important to find a solution that would
  ensure the family''s finances were properly managed and protected.


  Increasing understanding: The family members had different perspectives on how the
  family''s finances should be managed. It was important to find a solution that would
  help them understand each other''s perspectives and come to a compromise.


  ACTION:


  I would recommend that a similar solution to the one implemented by the family''s
  educational counselor be adopted. The family should hire an independent financial
  advisor to manage their finances and provide regular reports to all members of the
  family. The advisor should be selected based on their expertise and track record
  in financial management.


  The advisor should work with the family to develop a financial plan that takes into
  account the family''s goals and values. The plan should be transparent and all family
  members should have a say in its development. The advisor should also provide regular
  reports on the family''s finances, including details on income, expenses, investments,
  and any other relevant financial information.


  To ensure that the family members understand the financial reports, the advisor
  should provide explanations and answer any questions that they may have. The advisor
  should also be available to meet with family members individually or in groups to
  discuss any concerns or questions they may have.


  The expected result of this action is that the family''s finances will be properly
  managed, and all family members will have access to transparent and accurate financial
  information. This will help to reduce any concerns or suspicions that family members
  may have about the management of their finances, and will help to prevent any future
  conflicts. By working together to develop a financial plan, the family members will
  also have a better understanding of each other''s perspectives and values, which
  will help to strengthen family relationships.'

original_scenario: The extended family of the Tui family in the South Pacific was
  in turmoil due to a conflict over finances. The patriarch of the family, Tui Sr.,
  had been managing the family's finances for decades, but his children and grandchildren
  were skeptical of his methods. They suspected that he had been misusing the family's
  funds and were concerned about the lack of transparency in his financial management.
  Tensions came to a head when Tui Sr. refused to disclose the family's financial
  records to his heirs, leading to a heated argument that turned violent. The family
  members accused each other of embezzlement and fraud, and the situation quickly
  escalated into a full-blown family feud. The younger generation felt that they deserved
  a say in the family's finances, while the older generation felt that they had earned
  the right to manage the family's wealth. The conflict threatened to tear the family
  apart, but the family's educational counselor intervened and helped them come to
  a compromise. The family agreed to hire an independent financial advisor to manage
  their finances and provide regular reports to all members of the family. The compromise
  helped to restore trust and unity within the Tui family, and they were able to move
  forward without any further conflict.
