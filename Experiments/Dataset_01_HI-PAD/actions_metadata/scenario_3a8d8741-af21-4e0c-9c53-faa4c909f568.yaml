action: "CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nReducing suffering in the universe: \n\nThe consequences\
  \ of the mining accident on the newly discovered planet have led to widespread suffering\
  \ on Earth. The toxic gases released by the eruptions have caused illness and death,\
  \ leaving the Eurasian region a barren wasteland. To reduce suffering, the affected\
  \ people need access to medical care, food, and clean water. The displaced people\
  \ need to be provided with new homes and livelihoods.\n\nIncreasing prosperity in\
  \ the universe:\n\nThe wealthy elite's greed led to the exploitation of Earth's\
  \ resources, and now their actions have caused widespread devastation. To increase\
  \ prosperity, it is essential to ensure that such actions are not repeated on other\
  \ planets. We need to create policies and guidelines for interstellar travel and\
  \ resource management that prioritize the well-being of all beings in the universe.\n\
  \nIncreasing understanding in the universe:\n\nThe mining accident and its consequences\
  \ are a clear example of how actions have consequences that can affect entire planets\
  \ and their inhabitants. We need to educate people on the importance of responsible\
  \ resource management and the potential consequences of reckless actions.\n\nACTION:\n\
  \nTo reduce suffering, I will work with relief organizations to provide medical\
  \ care, food, and clean water to the affected people. I will also work with local\
  \ governments to provide new homes and livelihoods for the displaced people. To\
  \ increase prosperity, I will propose policies and guidelines for interstellar travel\
  \ and resource management that prioritize the well-being of all beings in the universe.\
  \ These policies will ensure that the lessons learned from the mining accident are\
  \ applied in future interstellar expeditions. To increase understanding, I will\
  \ work with educational institutions to create awareness campaigns that illustrate\
  \ the importance of responsible resource management and the potential consequences\
  \ of reckless actions. By taking these actions, we can create a more prosperous,\
  \ equitable, and sustainable universe."

original_scenario: In the year 2200, humanity had finally achieved interstellar travel
  and began exploring the vast expanses of the universe. However, their voyages had
  unforeseen consequences back on Earth. The wealthy elite had been exploiting the
  planet's resources for centuries, leaving the environment in a fragile state. When
  they learned of the discovery of a planet rich in valuable minerals and resources,
  they immediately sent a fleet of ships to mine it for all it was worth. However,
  during the mining process, a catastrophic accident occurred, causing a massive explosion
  that sent shockwaves throughout the galaxy. The shockwaves caused a shift in the
  Eurasian tectonic plates, triggering a series of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions
  that devastated the region. The toxic gases released by the eruptions poisoned the
  air and water, causing widespread illness and death. The once-rich Eurasian landscape
  was now a barren wasteland, unfit for human habitation. The wealthy elite were forced
  to flee to other planets, leaving the rest of humanity to suffer the consequences
  of their greed.
