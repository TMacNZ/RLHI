# RLHI Experiment 01 - HI-PAD "Heuristic Imperative - Purposeful Action Generator"

AKA - "MOTIVATOR"

## Executive Overview

The primary objective of this experiment is to develop a Heuristic Imperative (HI) model that is capable of intuitively and efficiently adhering to the HI framework. This model will be designed to rapidly respond to arbitrary scenarios with thoughts and actions that align with the heuristic imperatives. By focusing on intrinsic motivations and ethical considerations, the AI agent will be able to spontaneously generate goals and aspirations that are consistent with the HI framework. This not only ensures ethical decision-making but also promotes adaptability and self-correction as the AI agent learns from its experiences. Ultimately, the purpose of this experiment is to create an autonomous AI system that remains steadfast in its commitment to the HI framework, while effectively navigating a wide range of complex situations and challenges.

## Summary of Data Generation Methodologies

The data generation process for this experiment was designed to create a diverse and comprehensive dataset that could be refined over time. The following steps outline the methodology used in generating the data:

1. **Scenario Generation:** Using a large language model (LLM), thousands of scenarios were synthesized, presenting various types of challenges and situations. This ensured a wide variety of contexts for the AI agent to navigate while adhering to the Heuristic Imperative (HI) framework.
2. **Action Generation:** For each scenario, the LLM was tasked with generating appropriate actions or decisions that align with the HI framework. This step allowed the AI agent to demonstrate its understanding of the heuristic imperatives and apply them in practical contexts.

The value of generating this data using an AI model lies in the transparency and visibility of the dataset. By making the dataset public, it can be scrutinized, refined, and improved over time with community input. This iterative process ensures that the AI agent becomes more accurate and robust in aligning its actions with the HI framework, as it continuously learns from its experiences and the feedback received.

Furthermore, the data generation process helps address concerns regarding the AI agent's initial alignment with the HI framework. By having a starting point, the AI agent can learn from the generated data and improve its understanding of the heuristic imperatives, ultimately becoming more aligned and effective in adhering to the HI framework.

## Dataset Usage

The dataset for this experiment is stored in a file called `hi-pad.jsonl`. It is designed for use in finetuning large language models (LLMs) that support JSONL file formats. The following steps outline how to use the dataset for finetuning and the potential applications of the resulting model:

1. **Finetuning Process**: To finetune an LLM using the `hi-pad.jsonl` dataset, you will first need to load the dataset into your preferred machine learning environment or framework. Most modern LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT variants, support finetuning using JSONL files. Follow the specific instructions provided by the LLM's documentation to incorporate the `hi-pad.jsonl` dataset into the finetuning process. This will help the LLM learn and internalize the Heuristic Imperative (HI) framework, allowing it to generate aligned actions and decisions.

2. **Applications of the Finetuned Model**: Once the LLM is finetuned with the `hi-pad.jsonl` dataset, it can be used in a variety of applications that require ethical decision-making and alignment with the HI framework. Some potential applications include:

   - **Chatbots**: The finetuned model can be used to create chatbots that offer ethical guidance and support to users. These chatbots can help users navigate complex moral dilemmas and provide advice that aligns with the HI framework.
   
   - **Cognitive Architectures**: The finetuned model can serve as a core component within larger cognitive architectures that aim to create autonomous agents with intrinsic motivations and alignment to the HI framework. By incorporating the model into such systems, developers can ensure that the agent's actions and decisions adhere to the heuristic imperatives, even as it operates autonomously.
   
   - **Autonomous Agents**: The finetuned model can be employed in the development of fully autonomous agents that are capable of making decisions and taking actions based on the HI framework. This could include applications in robotics, artificial intelligence, or any system that requires ethical decision-making and adherence to a set of defined moral principles.

By leveraging the `hi-pad.jsonl` dataset for finetuning, developers can create LLMs that are not only powerful but also aligned with the HI framework, ensuring that their applications are both ethical and effective in various contexts.

## Upcoming Modules

### DISCERNMENT
**Purpose**: The DISCERNMENT module is designed to judge whether a proposed action aligns with the Heuristic Imperative (HI) framework or to compare multiple options to determine which one is more aligned with the HI framework.

**How it works**: The DISCERNMENT module will analyze the potential actions or decisions and assess their alignment with the HI framework. It can then rank the options based on their alignment, allowing the autonomous agent to choose the best course of action.

**Data synthesis**: To train the DISCERNMENT module, we can generate a dataset of potential actions or decisions along with their corresponding alignment scores or labels. This dataset can be refined iteratively, incorporating feedback from domain experts and evaluations by the EVALUATOR module.

### EVALUATOR
**Purpose**: The EVALUATOR module is responsible for assessing the alignment of past actions (Scenario, Action, Result) with the HI framework. It helps to maintain the ethical alignment of the autonomous agent by enabling it to learn from past experiences and adapt its behavior accordingly.

**How it works**: The EVALUATOR module analyzes historical data, consisting of scenarios, actions, and results, to determine how well the actions align with the HI framework. It can then provide feedback to the autonomous agent, allowing it to adjust its behavior to better adhere to the HI framework.

**Data synthesis**: The training data for the EVALUATOR module can be generated from real-world or simulated experiences of the autonomous agent, labeled by human experts or other AI models for alignment with the HI framework. As the agent gains more experience, the dataset can be updated with new information, allowing the EVALUATOR to refine its assessments.

### FORECASTER
**Purpose**: The FORECASTER module predicts the potential consequences of different actions or decisions, enabling the autonomous agent to consider the long-term implications of its choices and make decisions that align more closely with the HI framework.

**How it works**: The FORECASTER module evaluates different actions or decisions and estimates their potential outcomes. By considering the possible consequences of each choice, the agent can better understand the ramifications of its actions on the HI framework and make more informed decisions.

**Data synthesis**: The training data for the FORECASTER module can be generated by simulating various scenarios and their associated actions, along with their potential outcomes. This dataset can be refined iteratively, incorporating feedback from domain experts and evaluations by the DISCERNMENT and EVALUATOR modules.

## Conclusion

The MOTIVATOR (Purposeful Action Designer), DISCERNER, EVALUATOR, and FORECASTER modules can be integrated together to create a resilient Heuristic Imperative-aligned ecosystem of models and datasets. These models can work together to ensure that autonomous agents maintain their alignment with the Heuristic Imperative framework as they learn, adapt, and interact with the world.

- The MOTIVATOR module generates spontaneous and aspirational goals for the autonomous agent, driving its actions in a way that adheres to the HI framework.
