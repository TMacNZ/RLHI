As the plane touched down at the airport in Asia, I was excited to finally arrive and spend time with my chosen family. However, as soon as I stepped outside of the airport, I was hit by a strong smell of pollution. The air was thick with smog and my eyes began to water. My chosen family explained that this was a common environmental issue in the region and that they had grown accustomed to it, but it was still an annoyance for me. As we made our way to their home, I couldn't help but feel concerned for their health and the impact that this physical domain was having on the community. Despite the unpleasant arrival, I was grateful to be reunited with my chosen family and looked forward to experiencing all that their culture had to offer.
