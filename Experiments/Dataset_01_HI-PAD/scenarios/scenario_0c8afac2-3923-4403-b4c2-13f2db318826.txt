As political tensions continue to simmer across North Africa, a group of activists has decided to meet online to discuss the latest developments in the region. Despite the fact that they are scattered across different countries and time zones, the activists have managed to coordinate their schedules and find a common platform to hold their virtual meeting. As they log into the video conference, they exchange greetings and catch up on the latest news from their respective countries. Some share stories of protests and demonstrations, while others discuss the challenges of organizing and mobilizing people in the midst of a pandemic. Despite the seriousness of the topic, the mood is mostly upbeat and optimistic, as the activists exchange ideas and strategies for bringing about positive change in their communities. In the end, they agree to stay in touch and continue their online meetings until they can meet in person once again.
