As the host of a highly anticipated educational conference in the Pacific region, Dr. Kim was feeling the pressure to ensure the event ran smoothly. Everything seemed to be going according to plan until one of the keynote speakers, Dr. Lee, arrived at the venue.

Dr. Lee had a reputation for being difficult to work with and had a history of causing disagreements and arguments with other professionals in the field. Despite this, Dr. Kim had hoped that they could put their differences aside and work together for the sake of the conference.

However, as soon as Dr. Lee arrived, they began to argue with Dr. Kim over the schedule and the topics that they were supposed to cover in their keynote speech. Dr. Lee insisted that they had been given more time to speak, while Dr. Kim argued that the schedule had already been finalized and could not be changed.

The argument quickly escalated, with both speakers raising their voices and becoming increasingly agitated. The other attendees looked on in shock and disbelief, wondering how such a serious disagreement could have arisen between two respected professionals in the field.

In the end, Dr. Kim and Dr. Lee were unable to come to an agreement, and Dr. Lee decided to leave the conference early. This left Dr. Kim to manage the rest of the event on their own, which was a difficult task given the tension that had been created.

Despite the setback, the conference was still a success, with attendees praising the other speakers and the valuable insights that they had gained. However, Dr. Kim couldn't help but feel disappointed that the disagreement with Dr. Lee had overshadowed what was otherwise a productive and engaging event.
