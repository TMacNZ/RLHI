Anna, a pregnant woman in her third trimester, was driving to a doctor's appointment in a remote part of Europe when her car suddenly veered off the road and crashed into a tree. She was left unconscious, and it was hours before she was found by a passing car. The severity of the accident caused Anna to go into premature labor, and she was rushed to a nearby hospital where she gave birth to a premature baby boy. The medical bills for both Anna and her newborn were staggering, and her insurance did not cover all of the costs. The incident put Anna and her family in a precarious economic situation, as they struggled to pay off the medical debt while also adjusting to the challenges of caring for a premature baby.
