The extended family of the Sharma's in South Asia were going through an incredible financial crisis. It all started when the patriarch of the family, Mr. Sharma, invested all his savings in a new business venture that turned out to be a scam. The family was left with no savings and mounting debts. The situation had become an annoyance for everyone in the family, with constant arguments and bickering over the financial situation. The intellectual members of the family tried to come up with a solution to the crisis but were unable to do so. The family had to cut down their expenses and sell off some of their assets to repay the debts. It was a difficult time for the Sharmas, but they were determined to get through it together as a family.
