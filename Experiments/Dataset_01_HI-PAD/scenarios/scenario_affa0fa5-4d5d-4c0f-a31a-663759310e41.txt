In the South Pacific, a long-lasting incident occurred that left the region's intellectual community in shock. It all started with a simple bed. One university's research department had been experimenting with a new type of bed that was supposed to improve sleep quality. They had installed the bed in one of the dorm rooms for testing. However, something went wrong with the bed's design, causing it to malfunction and trap its occupant. The student was stuck in the bed for hours before anyone realized what had happened. The incident resulted in a regional recall of all the beds, and the intellectual community began to question the safety protocols of the university's research department. The fallout from the incident was felt for years to come, and the incident led to increased scrutiny of research and development practices across the region.
