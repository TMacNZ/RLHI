In the post-truth era of politics, social media has become the battleground for politicians to gain support and sway public opinion. With the motion of a finger, anyone can start a political campaign or share fake news online. In Eurasia, this has become a social challenge that has fueled political polarization and undermined democracy. The ease with which false information can spread online has made it increasingly difficult for citizens to discern fact from fiction. Political leaders have taken advantage of this, using social media to manipulate public opinion and silence dissenting voices. As a result, the once vibrant political landscape has become a breeding ground for conspiracy theories and disinformation campaigns. The motion of a few keystrokes can now have a profound impact on the future of a nation.
