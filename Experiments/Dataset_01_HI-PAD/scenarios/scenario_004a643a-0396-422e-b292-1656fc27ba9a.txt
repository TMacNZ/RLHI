In a small neighborhood in North Africa, a serious ethical dilemma has arisen due to a technological advancement. A local company has developed a smart blanket that can monitor a person's vital signs and alert emergency services if any irregularities are detected. While this technology could potentially save lives, it has raised concerns about privacy and surveillance. Some residents feel uncomfortable with the idea of a blanket monitoring their every move, while others see it as a necessary safety measure. The company insists that all data collected is kept confidential and only shared with emergency services in case of an emergency. However, there are worries that this information could be misused or sold to third-party companies. The community is divided on whether to embrace this technological advancement or reject it out of fear for their privacy. As the debate rages on, the smart blanket remains a controversial issue in this North African neighborhood.
