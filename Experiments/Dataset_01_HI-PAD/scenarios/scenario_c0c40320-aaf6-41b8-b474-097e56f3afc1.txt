In a small village in North Africa, there was a chosen family consisting of a grandmother, her daughter, and her granddaughter. One day, while baking bread in the oven, the grandmother noticed that the oven was not working properly. She immediately called her daughter to come and take a look at it. Her daughter, who had recently returned from studying abroad, suggested that they replace the oven with a newer and more efficient one. The granddaughter, however, strongly disagreed. She argued that the old oven was a part of their cultural heritage and that they should keep it as a symbol of their tradition. This disagreement led to a heated argument between the three generations, each holding onto their own beliefs and values. The argument lasted for several days, with each member of the family refusing to back down. Eventually, they came to a compromise, agreeing to keep the old oven but also to purchase a new one for more efficient use. This disagreement had a long-lasting impact on the family, but it also taught them the importance of respecting each other's cultural beliefs and values, even in the face of modernization.
