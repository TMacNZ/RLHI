In Europe, a chosen family of environmental activists are faced with a life-threatening issue - the destruction of the universe they have come to love and protect. For years, they have been tirelessly fighting against the pollution and degradation of their beloved planet, but now, they find themselves facing a new challenge. A large corporation has been dumping hazardous waste into the nearby river, causing a ripple effect that is slowly but surely destroying the ecosystem. If left unchecked, this pollution could spread and ultimately impact the very fabric of the universe they call home. The activists are determined to take action and put a stop to this environmental disaster before it's too late. They mobilize their community to gather resources and support, and they begin to organize a protest and put pressure on the corporation to take responsibility for its actions. Their chosen family is united in their mission to protect the universe, and they will stop at nothing to ensure its survival.
