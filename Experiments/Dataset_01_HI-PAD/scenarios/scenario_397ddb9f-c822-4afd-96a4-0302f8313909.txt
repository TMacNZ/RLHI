In a bustling city in Asia, a minor technological failure caused a language barrier in the legal system. The translation software used by the courts suddenly stopped working, leaving judges and lawyers unable to communicate with non-native speakers. While the severity of the situation was insignificant, it caused delays and frustration for those involved in legal proceedings. Some cases had to be rescheduled, and interpreters had to be hired at an additional cost. Despite the setback, the city quickly worked to resolve the issue and implement a more reliable translation system. Thankfully, the language barrier was only a temporary inconvenience and did not cause any major legal problems.
