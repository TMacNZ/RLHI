Maria, a lawyer in Brazil, was in the middle of a high-profile case when her computer suddenly shut down. She tried restarting it, but it wouldn't turn on. Panicking, Maria took her computer to a technician to examine it. The technician discovered that the motherboard had malfunctioned, and all of Maria's case files were irretrievable. Maria was devastated, as she had spent countless hours preparing for the case, and now she had to start from scratch. She had to request an extension from the court, which was granted, but she knew that the setback could seriously impact the outcome of the case. Maria learned the hard way that she should have backed up her files, and she vowed to never make the same mistake again.
