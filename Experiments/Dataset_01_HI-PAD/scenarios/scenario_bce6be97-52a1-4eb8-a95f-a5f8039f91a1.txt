As the eldest son in his family, Tunde felt a great sense of responsibility towards his extended family. So when his cousin, Bola, asked for a loan to cover her medical bills, Tunde didn't hesitate. However, a few days later, Tunde found out that Bola had used the money to pay for her brother's tuition fees instead. This put Tunde in a difficult position. On one hand, he understood that education was a top priority in their culture, but on the other hand, he felt that Bola had betrayed his trust. Tunde decided to confront Bola and check if she had any intentions of repaying the loan. He also had to weigh the importance of maintaining harmonious relations within the family against his ethical stance on the matter.
