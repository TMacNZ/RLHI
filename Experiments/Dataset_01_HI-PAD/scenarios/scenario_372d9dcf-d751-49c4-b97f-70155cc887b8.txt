In the year 2300, the Intergalactic Education Council faced a pressing ethical dilemma. The council had recently introduced a new language program that included French as a mandatory language for all students. However, during the course of the program, it was discovered that the French language had a cultural connotation that was offensive to the indigenous people of the South Pacific. The French had colonized many of the islands in the region, and their language was associated with oppression and exploitation. The council was now faced with a difficult decision: should they continue to teach French and risk offending the indigenous people, or should they remove the language from the program and risk limiting their students' language skills? It was a typical situation that required careful consideration and sensitivity to both the cultural and educational needs of the students.
