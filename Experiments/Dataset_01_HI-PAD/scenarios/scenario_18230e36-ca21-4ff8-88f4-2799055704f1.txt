In the Pacific region, a devastating environmental issue has arisen that threatens to irreversibly damage the chosen family of a small community. The problem at hand is that there is no viable solution to the pollution that is plaguing the waters and shores of their once-pristine home. The political domain has been slow to act and the severity of the situation is becoming increasingly evident. The chosen family, a tight-knit community of individuals who have come together to form a family of their own choosing, are facing the heartbreaking prospect of having to abandon their beloved home. They have fought tirelessly to find a solution to the pollution, but with no viable options in sight, they must now face the reality that they may have to say goodbye to the only family they have ever known.
