The residents of a small village in Subsaharan Africa were experiencing an annoyance that was slowly turning into a bigger issue. The political leaders of the village had failed to adjust the distribution of resources to meet the growing population's needs. The villagers were struggling to access basic amenities like water and electricity, and this had led to a decline in living standards. The political leaders were not taking any action despite the residents' pleas to adjust the distribution of resources. As a result, the villagers had started to lose faith in the political system, and there were whispers of a possible uprising. The situation was becoming more complex as the villagers were divided into factions with different ideas on how to address the issue. The leaders needed to act fast and find a solution to the problem before it spiraled out of control.
