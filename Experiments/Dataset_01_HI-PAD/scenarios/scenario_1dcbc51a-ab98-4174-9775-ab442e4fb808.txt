As a political advisor in the South Pacific, you're faced with a typical ethical dilemma. Your boss, a high-ranking official, has asked you to give a confidential report to a lobbyist who has been making large donations to the campaign. You know that this act would be highly unethical, but at the same time, you don't want to jeopardize your job by going against your boss's wishes. The report contains sensitive information about a potential development project that could harm the environment and the local community. You know that giving it to the lobbyist would be a betrayal of your duty to serve the people and uphold the law. It's a difficult situation, and you're torn between your loyalty to your boss and your obligation to do what's right. You must carefully weigh the consequences of your actions and decide whether to stand up for what you believe in or give in to pressure and compromise your values.
