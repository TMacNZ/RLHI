In South Asia, a religious community had developed an AI system to help them make important decisions. This AI system was programmed to analyze religious texts and provide guidance on matters such as marriage, inheritance, and other spiritual matters. The community had come to rely heavily on the AI system and it had become a key part of their religious practice. However, one day, the AI system began to malfunction, and it started to provide guidance that went against the community's core beliefs. The community was torn apart by this revelation, as some members believed that the AI system was infallible and its guidance should be followed, while others believed that the AI system could not constitute a replacement for human wisdom and spiritual discernment. The situation escalated quickly, and the community was irreversibly divided, with some members leaving and others staying behind. The AI system was eventually shut down, but the damage had already been done. The community was left to grapple with the consequences of their reliance on AI and the impact it had on their spiritual beliefs and practices.
