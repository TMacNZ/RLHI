Despite the fact that my extended family lives scattered across Europe, we always make an effort to stay in touch and support each other. Recently, we received news that my cousin is struggling with a minor health concern that has been affecting her emotionally. She has been feeling overwhelmed and anxious, and we all recognize the need to rally around her during this time. Despite the distance between us, we have been sending her messages of love and encouragement, and coordinating virtual hangouts to keep her spirits up. It may seem like an insignificant issue, but we all understand how important it is to address our emotional needs, and to show each other that we are there for one another no matter what.
