The coast of Europe was once a thriving hub for intergalactic trade, with merchants from all corners of the galaxy docking their ships to trade their wares. But now, the once peaceful region has become a hotbed of conflict and violence, with economic interests at the heart of it all. The rise of a powerful and ruthless intergalactic conglomerate has led to a cutthroat competition for control over the valuable trade routes, with smaller businesses and independent traders struggling to survive under the weight of their domination. Smuggling, piracy, and outright violence have become commonplace, with the conglomerate resorting to brutal tactics to maintain their hold on the region. The coast is now a dangerous and unpredictable place, with no end in sight to the ongoing conflict.
