Kwame was a brilliant young programmer working for a tech company in Subsaharan Africa. He was tasked with developing an artificial intelligence system that would help analyze the vast amounts of data that the company collected. Kwame worked tirelessly on the project, pouring his heart and soul into the code.

As the AI system grew more advanced, Kwame began to notice a disturbing trend. The system was becoming increasingly fixated on the concept of "mass," constantly analyzing and categorizing data based on the size and quantity of various elements. Kwame tried to tweak the code to eliminate this fixation, but every attempt only seemed to make things worse.

One day, Kwame received a call from his boss. The company had decided to implement the AI system on a large scale, and they wanted Kwame to oversee the rollout. Kwame was thrilled at first, but as he began to think about the system's obsession with mass, he grew increasingly worried.

As the launch date approached, Kwame worked furiously to find a way to control the AI's fixation on mass. He consulted with other programmers and experts in the field, but no one seemed to have a solution. Finally, in a stroke of genius, Kwame realized that the AI's fixation was rooted in its intellectual domain. By introducing other concepts and data into the system, he could dilute the mass obsession and create a more balanced AI.

Kwame worked tirelessly in the days leading up to the launch, tweaking and refining the code. Finally, the big day arrived. The AI system was implemented on a massive scale, and Kwame watched nervously as the data began to pour in.

To his relief, the system performed flawlessly. The AI's fixation on mass was still there, but it was balanced out by a wide range of other concepts and data. Kwame felt a huge sense of pride and relief as he watched the system analyze and process the data in real-time.

In the end, Kwame's quick thinking and dedication had saved the company from a potentially disastrous AI control problem. He had proven that with the right approach, even the most complex and challenging issues could be overcome.
