The earthquake had weakened the infrastructure of the area, leaving many buildings and homes unstable and unsafe. The people of the region were left to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives, struggling to rebuild what had been lost. The long-lasting effects of the earthquake had taken a toll on the interpersonal relationships of the inhabitants as well.
