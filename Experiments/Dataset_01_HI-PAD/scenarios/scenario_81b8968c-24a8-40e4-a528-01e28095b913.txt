Hello was the code word for emergencies amongst the chosen family of street artists in New York City. They were a close-knit group who relied on each other for everything. One night, while working on a mural in an abandoned building, one of them accidentally knocked over a can of spray paint, causing a spark that ignited a nearby gas leak. The resulting explosion was deafening and shook the entire block.

The group quickly sprang into action, shouting "Hello! Hello!" into their walkie-talkies to alert the others that there was an emergency. They checked on each other to make sure everyone was okay, and then began assessing the damage. The building was on fire, and they knew they had to act fast to prevent it from spreading to neighboring buildings.

They worked together to extinguish the flames, using whatever materials they could find. They broke into nearby stores to grab fire extinguishers and buckets of water. They used their spray paint cans to create a makeshift barrier to prevent the fire from spreading.

As they worked, they realized just how dangerous the situation was. The fire had spread quickly, and they were lucky that no one had been seriously injured. They knew that they needed to be more careful in the future, and make sure that they always had a plan in case of emergencies.

Despite the danger, the chosen family of street artists continued to work together, creating amazing works of art that brightened up the streets of North America. And whenever they needed help, they knew they could rely on saying "Hello" to their family to come to their aid.
