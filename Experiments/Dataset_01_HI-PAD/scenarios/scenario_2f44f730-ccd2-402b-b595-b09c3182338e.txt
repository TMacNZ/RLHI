In the year 2077, the interstellar community was in a state of drama as the subsaharan region of Africa was facing a severe environmental issue. The region was suffering from a dangerous physical problem that was spreading like wildfire. The atmosphere was becoming toxic, and the air quality was deteriorating at a rapid pace. The local residents were unable to breathe properly, and many were falling sick. The cause of this issue was traced back to the large-scale dumping of hazardous waste materials by the interstellar companies operating in the region. The situation was getting out of hand, and if not addressed urgently, it would have dire consequences for the entire planet. The interstellar community had to come together to find a solution to this environmental crisis and prevent any further damage to the world.
