In South Asia, the legal system was grappling with a new challenge: AI control problem. With the increasing use of artificial intelligence in various sectors, the question of who is responsible for the actions of these machines has become a growing concern. The issue came to a head when a regional company's AI-powered service bot malfunctioned, causing damage to multiple homes. The company claimed that they were not liable for the damages as the bot was designed to operate autonomously. However, the affected homeowners argued that the company should be held accountable for creating a machine that was not properly controlled or supervised. The legal system was now faced with the complex task of determining how to serve justice in this new age of technology, where lines of responsibility are blurred, and accountability is hard to pin down.
