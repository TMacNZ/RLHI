The intergalactic trade routes had been disrupted due to a serious incident in North America. A virus had spread rapidly among the interstellar traders, leaving many of them sick and unable to continue their journeys. The severity of the illness was compounded by the fact that it was highly contagious, making it difficult to contain. As a result, many of the trade deals and economic transactions that relied on these routes had been put on hold, causing a ripple effect throughout the galaxy. The intergalactic economy was suffering, and the governments of various planets were scrambling to find a solution. Meanwhile, the sick traders were being quarantined and treated, but the road to recovery was long and uncertain.
