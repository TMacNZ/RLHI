In the South Pacific, a technological social challenge has arisen at the national level. The issue is centered around the need to bring people together virtually, given the vast distances that separate the population. With limited resources, it has become increasingly difficult to provide access to digital technology and internet connectivity to all areas. This has led to disparities in access between urban and rural communities, with the latter at a disadvantage. The government is working to address this issue by investing in infrastructure and providing subsidies to internet service providers. However, progress is slow, and many citizens still lack the means to connect with each other digitally. The challenge is to find innovative solutions that can bridge this gap and bring people together, regardless of their location or socio-economic status.
