In the year 2150, humanity had successfully colonized several planets across the galaxy. One of the most prosperous colonies was located on a planet in the Europe region, with a population of diverse cultures and beliefs. However, a conflict arose when a group of intellectuals proposed a new law that would restrict sexual activity among colonists. This proposal sparked outrage among the population, as sex was seen as a natural human activity and a means of procreation. The intellectuals argued that the restriction would prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies, but many saw it as an infringement on their personal freedom. The debate quickly turned violent, with riots breaking out in the streets and protesters clashing with law enforcement. The annoyance caused by the proposal had now escalated into a full-blown conflict, threatening the stability of the entire colony.
