Detecting cultural differences is a crucial skill in any professional setting, especially in the Middle East where social customs and traditions can vary greatly from Western norms. However, despite their best efforts, misunderstandings and disagreements can still arise between colleagues from different cultural backgrounds.

This was exactly the case for Sarah, a young marketing executive who had recently joined a Dubai-based advertising agency. Sarah had grown up in the United States and was used to a more direct communication style, whereas her Emirati colleague, Saleh, valued indirect communication and saving face.

Their disagreement started when Sarah presented a new campaign idea to Saleh and the rest of the team. She was surprised when Saleh didn't immediately give his opinion, as she was used to receiving quick feedback from her American colleagues. Saleh, on the other hand, took his time to process the information and provide a more nuanced response.

Sarah interpreted Saleh's silence as disapproval and became defensive, arguing that her idea had been successful in previous campaigns. Saleh, on the other hand, felt that Sarah was being pushy and not respecting the cultural norms of the workplace.

Their argument was eventually resolved when their manager intervened and explained the different communication styles and cultural values at play. Sarah and Saleh were able to find a compromise, with Sarah learning to give Saleh more space to process ideas and Saleh learning to be more upfront with his feedback.

From that point on, Sarah made a conscious effort to detect and respect cultural differences in her workplace, leading to a more harmonious and collaborative team environment.
