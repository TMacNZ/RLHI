In Subsaharan Africa, there is a critical health concern that is affecting the economic domain of the region. The issue of concern is the grab of resources that are meant to be used for healthcare purposes. Due to the shortage of resources in the region, healthcare facilities are struggling to provide the necessary care to patients. However, corrupt officials and individuals are taking advantage of the situation by seizing the limited resources for their own personal gain. This has led to a decline in the quality of healthcare provided to the population, resulting in increased mortality rates and decreased productivity due to illness. The situation has become a major challenge for the region, and urgent action needs to be taken to address this issue.
