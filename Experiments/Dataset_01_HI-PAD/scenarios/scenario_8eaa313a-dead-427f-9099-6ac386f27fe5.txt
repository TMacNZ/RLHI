In many countries throughout Subsaharan Africa, one of the biggest social challenges faced by citizens is finding stable employment. Many individuals struggle to secure a job that pays a living wage and provides benefits, leaving them in a constant state of financial instability. Compounding this issue is the fact that the majority of employers in the region are international companies, which can create a power imbalance in the employer-employee relationship. This dynamic can lead to exploitation and mistreatment, as international employers may not be held to the same labor standards as local companies. As a result, political leaders in the region are grappling with how to address this critical issue and ensure that all citizens have access to dignified employment opportunities, regardless of who their employer may be.
