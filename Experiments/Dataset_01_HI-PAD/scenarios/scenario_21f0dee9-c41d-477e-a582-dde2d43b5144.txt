In the year 2150, the interstellar community had reached a consensus on the importance of fitness for all species. However, during a diplomatic mission to North Africa, a cultural challenge arose. The local inhabitants found it annoying and disrespectful that the visiting aliens were constantly promoting their fitness regimens and encouraging them to exercise. The North Africans believed that their traditional way of life, which involved a lot of physical labor, was enough to maintain their health. The aliens struggled to understand this cultural difference, as they had always viewed fitness as a universal concept. The situation created tension between the two groups, and the interstellar community had to work on finding a solution that respected cultural diversity while still promoting healthy habits.
