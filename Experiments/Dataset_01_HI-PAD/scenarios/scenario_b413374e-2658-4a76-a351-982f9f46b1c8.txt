In the rapidly evolving field of AI, a typical problem has arisen in the Middle East region regarding legal control over AI systems. With the advancement of technology, the capabilities of AI systems have risen far above what was once thought possible. The question now arises as to who is responsible for regulating these systems and ensuring that they do not cause harm or act inappropriately. The legal domain must step in to establish clear guidelines and regulations for the development, implementation, and use of AI technology. The potential impact of AI on society and the economy is immense, and it is imperative that legal professionals take the initiative to address this control problem before it spirals out of control.
