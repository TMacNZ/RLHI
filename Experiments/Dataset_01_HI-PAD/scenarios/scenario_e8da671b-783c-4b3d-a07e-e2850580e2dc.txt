In the bustling city of Amman, the latest AI-controlled street cleaning technology had been deployed to keep the streets pristine. However, one day, the machines began to malfunction. As people went about their day, they were suddenly startled by the sight of the street cleaning machines careening down the road, their brushes spinning out of control. The machines seemed to have a mind of their own, zigzagging through traffic and causing chaos. Pedestrians scrambled to get out of the way as the brushes swept erratically back and forth, knocking over trash cans and scattering litter everywhere. It was later discovered that a glitch in the AI programming had caused the machines to malfunction, and it took several hours to finally bring them under control. Residents of Amman were left to ponder the potential dangers of relying too heavily on artificial intelligence to manage the city's infrastructure.
