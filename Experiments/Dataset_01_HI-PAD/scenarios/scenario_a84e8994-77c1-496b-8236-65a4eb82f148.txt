In the year 2215, interstellar travel had become commonplace. Spaceships from various planets traveled across galaxies, transporting people and goods. However, one issue that remained mundane yet long-lasting was advertising.

In South Asia, a political debate had erupted over the use of advertising in interstellar travel. Some argued that it was necessary for businesses to advertise their products and services to travelers. Others believed that it was intrusive and took away from the natural beauty of space.

The debate reached new heights when a major corporation began projecting their advertisements onto planets and moons. The bright lights and loud sounds disrupted the natural rhythms of these celestial bodies and caused an uproar among environmentalists.

Protesters took to the streets, calling for a ban on all interstellar advertising. The government was torn between protecting the rights of businesses and preserving the integrity of space. It was a delicate balance that they struggled to maintain.

As the debate raged on, a compromise was eventually reached. Businesses were allowed to advertise on spaceships and inside space stations, but all projections onto planets and moons were banned. It was a small victory for environmentalists, but it was a step in the right direction.

Years later, as interstellar travel continued to evolve, the memory of the great interstellar advertising debate lingered. It served as a reminder that even the most mundane issues could have a long-lasting impact on the world around us.
