While vacationing in the South Pacific, a young couple found themselves in a heated argument with a local tour guide. The disagreement arose when the couple expressed concern over the guide's decision to take them snorkeling in an area known for its dangerous currents. Despite the couple's protests, the guide insisted that the area was safe and proceeded to lead the group into the water. As they swam further from the shore, the couple noticed that the current was indeed stronger than they had anticipated, and they struggled to keep afloat. The guide, who had initially ignored their pleas for caution, finally realized the danger and quickly helped them back to the safety of the shore. The argument continued as the couple expressed their anger and frustration towards the guide's recklessness, while the guide defended his decision as a common practice in his culture. The incident left the couple shaken but grateful to have escaped unharmed, while the guide remained firm in his belief that his actions were justified.
