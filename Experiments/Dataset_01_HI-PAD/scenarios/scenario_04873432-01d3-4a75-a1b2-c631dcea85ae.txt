Teaching in Subsaharan Africa can be a challenging task due to the lack of resources and infrastructure in many regions. Despite these difficulties, dedicated teachers work tirelessly to provide their students with an education that will give them a chance at a better future. In a typical classroom, students sit on worn wooden benches with no back support, while the teacher stands in front of a chalkboard that is faded and cracked. The teacher's voice competes with the sounds of children playing outside and the occasional bleat of a goat or cow passing by. Despite the distractions, the teacher remains focused and engaged, using creative methods to keep the students' attention. They draw pictures in the dirt with a stick to illustrate a point, or use songs and games to make the lesson more interactive. It's a mundane issue that teachers face every day, but their dedication and perseverance make a lasting impact on their students' lives.
