Between the years of 2018 and 2021, there was a drastic increase in the number of students in Asia who were experiencing life-threatening situations due to a mundane issue: lack of access to clean drinking water in schools. The issue was widespread across the region, affecting both rural and urban areas. Students were forced to drink contaminated water from taps or wells, leading to outbreaks of waterborne illnesses and even deaths in some cases. The problem was particularly acute in schools that lacked proper sanitation facilities. Despite efforts by national and federal authorities to address the issue, progress was slow due to bureaucratic hurdles and a lack of funding. As a result, many students continued to suffer, with their education and health put at risk. It was only after sustained pressure from advocacy groups and concerned citizens that action was taken to address the issue, with new policies and funding allocated to ensure that all schools in the region had access to clean drinking water and sanitation facilities.
