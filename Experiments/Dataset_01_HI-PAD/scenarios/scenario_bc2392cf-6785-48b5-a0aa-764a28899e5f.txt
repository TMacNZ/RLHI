Who is a common word that we use in our everyday conversations, but for a group of students in the South Pacific, it has become a major annoyance. In their local dialect, "who" means "anus," and they find it offensive when English-speaking teachers frequently use the word in their lessons.

The students have expressed their discomfort to their teachers, but many of them do not understand the issue and continue to use the word without considering its impact. This has led to a social challenge in the classroom, with some students feeling disrespected and uncomfortable.

To address this issue, the school has decided to implement an educational program that promotes cultural sensitivity and awareness. The program will include workshops on language and communication, as well as discussions on cultural differences and the importance of respecting them.

The school hopes that this program will not only help the students feel more comfortable in the classroom but also create a more inclusive and welcoming learning environment for everyone. The program will also encourage teachers to be more mindful of their language and consider the impact it may have on their students.

Through this educational program, the school aims to turn this annoyance into an opportunity for growth and understanding, creating a positive impact on the students' education and social experiences.
