Where they gathered together in their cozy living room, the chosen family had a weekly tradition of streaming their church service online. It was a chance for them to connect with their faith while also staying connected with each other, even though they lived in different parts of Europe. However, this week they encountered a technological failure that threatened to derail their plans. As they clicked on the link to start the stream, they were met with a blank screen and a spinning wheel. Frantic attempts to refresh the page or try different devices proved fruitless. Frustration and disappointment settled over the group as they realized they would have to miss their usual service. But they refused to let this setback shake their faith. Instead, they improvised by sharing personal anecdotes and prayers with each other, reminding themselves of the bond they shared and the strength of their spiritual connection beyond any technological glitches.
