Infection is a word that can strike fear into the hearts of many, and the emotional toll it takes is not to be underestimated. In Europe, the severity of this issue is critical, as interpersonal relationships are put to the test. The fear of infection has created a social challenge that is difficult to overcome. People are afraid to touch, hug, or be close to others, and this has led to a sense of disconnection and isolation. The emotional toll of this situation is palpable, as individuals are forced to navigate a world where physical touch is taboo. The loneliness and sense of detachment are profound, leaving people feeling vulnerable and exposed. It will take time for society to heal from the wounds of this infection, but with patience, compassion, and understanding, we can work towards a brighter future.
