After years of feeling like they didn't quite fit into their biological family, a group of friends decided to establish their own chosen family. They were all intellectuals, with a shared love for literature and philosophy. They rented a large house in the countryside of Europe, where they could live, work, and study together. At first, everything was perfect - they cooked meals together, debated deep topics late into the night, and supported each other through personal struggles. However, one day, a dangerous incident occurred. One of the members accidentally left a candle burning in their room, which caused a fire that quickly spread throughout the house. The intellectual family had to act quickly to escape the flames, and unfortunately, one member was injured in the process. While they were all grateful to have made it out alive, the incident shook them to their core. They realized that even in a close-knit community like theirs, accidents and tragedies could still occur. They made a pact to always be vigilant and take precautions to prevent any similar incidents from happening again in the future.
