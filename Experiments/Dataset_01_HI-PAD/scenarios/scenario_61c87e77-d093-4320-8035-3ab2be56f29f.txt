In many South American societies, extended families are the norm. This was the case for Maria and her family. She grew up surrounded by grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. However, as she got older and started attending school, she noticed a growing trend amongst her classmates. Many of them were victims of violence or conflict within their own extended families. Maria couldn't believe it at first. How could families who were supposed to love and protect each other turn on each other? But she soon realized that societal pressures and expectations often played a role in these conflicts. For example, when a young girl got pregnant out of wedlock, it was not uncommon for her own family to turn against her. The shame and stigma associated with such situations could lead to verbal or physical abuse. Maria was saddened by this reality and knew that education was key to breaking the cycle of violence and conflict within families. She made it her mission to raise awareness and encourage open dialogue about these issues in her community.
