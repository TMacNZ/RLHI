The dinner table discussion was getting heated as the family of four sat down for their weekly meal. The father, known for his political leanings, had just announced that he was considering running for a local political office. His teenage daughter, aspiring actress, couldn't help but roll her eyes in annoyance. She had heard enough about politics from her father and was tired of hearing him talk about it constantly. The father, sensing his daughter's disapproval, became defensive and accused her of being uninterested in the world around her. This sparked a disagreement between the two, with the mother and younger son caught in the middle. The argument continued throughout the meal, leaving a sour taste in everyone's mouth. The daughter couldn't help but feel frustrated that her father was more interested in being a politician than supporting her dreams of becoming an actor.
