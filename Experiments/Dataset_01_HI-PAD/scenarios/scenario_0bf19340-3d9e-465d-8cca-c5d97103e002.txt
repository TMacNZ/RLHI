In the year 2150, the Interstellar Bank had established itself as the largest and most influential financial institution in the galaxy. Operating on a scale that was previously unimaginable, the bank had amassed an unprecedented amount of wealth and power, with branches in every major star system. However, a catastrophic ethical dilemma had arisen when it was discovered that the bank had been funding the construction of a massive weapon of mass destruction in the South Pacific region of Earth. The bank had been funneling billions of credits to a rogue nation, which had been using the funds to build a device capable of destroying entire planets. As news of the bank's involvement spread, protests erupted across the galaxy, with many calling for the bank to be held accountable for its actions. The bank's top executives were faced with a difficult decision: should they continue to fund the weapon and risk the destruction of countless lives, or should they cut ties with the rogue nation and risk losing their massive profits and influence? The fate of the galaxy hung in the balance, and the bank's decision would have far-reaching consequences for years to come.
