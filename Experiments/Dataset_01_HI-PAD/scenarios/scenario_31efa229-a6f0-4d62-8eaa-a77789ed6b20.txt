The extended family gathered in the living room of their home in North Africa, huddling together as the bone-chilling winds of a sandstorm howled outside. The walls trembled with each gust, and the windows shook in their frames. The family patriarch, a weathered man with deep lines etched into his face, stood at the window, peering out into the swirling dust. They had weathered many sandstorms before, but this one was especially fierce. The children clung to their parents, their eyes wide with fear. The family knew that they would have to wait out the storm, as going outside could mean getting lost or injured in the blinding sand. They huddled together, sharing stories and memories to pass the time. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the winds began to die down, and the family emerged from their home, surveying the damage. The streets were coated in a thick layer of sand, and the air was still hazy with dust, but they were grateful to have made it through the storm safely.
