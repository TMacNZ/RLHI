In a remote village in North Africa, a group of rebels kidnapped a young girl and held her hostage in exchange for a rifle with cosmic powers that they believed would help them overthrow the government. The only person who possessed such a rifle was a wealthy businessman who had acquired it through illegal means. The dilemma emerged when the businessman was faced with the ethical question of whether to give up the rifle and potentially save the girl's life or to keep it and risk her death. The severity of the situation was life-threatening as the rebels had made it clear that they would not hesitate to harm the girl if their demands were not met. The legal ramifications of either decision weighed heavily on the businessman's mind as both options could result in serious consequences. He had to make a decision quickly as time was running out, and his choice would ultimately determine the fate of the young girl.
