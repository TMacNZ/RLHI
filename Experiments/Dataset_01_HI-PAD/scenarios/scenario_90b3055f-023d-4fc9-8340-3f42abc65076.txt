In North America, a life-threatening situation has emerged due to the behavior of individuals towards the environment. The issue is categorized as an environmental issue in the social domain. Despite numerous warnings and campaigns to reduce pollution and preserve natural resources, some individuals continue to engage in harmful behaviors. This behavior not only affects the environment but also the health and safety of individuals. For instance, air pollution has caused respiratory illnesses and has become a leading cause of death in some regions. Moreover, the depletion of natural resources such as water and forests has led to a decline in the quality of life for individuals living in affected areas. It is important for individuals to recognize the severity of their actions and take responsibility for preserving the environment for future generations.
