In a not-too-distant future, the scientific community of Europe had been working tirelessly to launch a groundbreaking intergalactic research mission. The stakes were high, as they were in direct competition with their main rival, a tech company from the United States. The plan was set, the team was assembled, and the technology was tested. But as the launch countdown began, disaster struck. A critical technological failure caused the rocket to malfunction, and the catastrophic explosion that followed not only destroyed the rocket, but also the entire launch facility. The implications of this failure were grave, as not only was the mission a complete failure, but the rival company had now secured a significant advantage in the race for intergalactic scientific discovery. The European scientific community was left to pick up the pieces and figure out how to catch up to their competitor, all while mourning the loss of their dreams and hard work.
