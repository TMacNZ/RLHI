In the vast region of Eurasia, online discussions around the importance of spirituality and religion have been spreading rapidly. However, a mundane issue has arisen that could have irreversible consequences. Several online platforms have been hacked, causing the deletion of numerous religious and spiritual documents that were stored on these platforms. This loss of information has caused uproar among religious and spiritual leaders who fear that future generations will not have access to these important texts. The severity of this issue cannot be ignored as it threatens to erase a crucial part of our collective history and understanding of spirituality and religion. Urgent measures need to be taken to prevent such attacks in the future and to ensure the preservation of these invaluable documents.
