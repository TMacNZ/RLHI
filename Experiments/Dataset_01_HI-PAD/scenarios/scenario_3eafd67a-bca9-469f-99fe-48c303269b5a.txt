In Subsaharan Africa, where natural disasters are unfortunately commonplace, the recent drought has caused economic hardships for many individuals. For one woman, who was already struggling to make ends meet, the drought has brought an additional annoyance: an unwanted pregnancy. Without the means to care for another child, she has made the difficult decision to seek an abortion. However, in this region where access to safe and legal abortion services is limited, she finds herself faced with a dangerous and potentially life-threatening situation. The economic impact of the drought has only exacerbated the already dire situation, leaving her with few options and little support.
