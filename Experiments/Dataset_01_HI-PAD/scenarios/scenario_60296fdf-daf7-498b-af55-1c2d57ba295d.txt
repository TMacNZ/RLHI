In a small neighborhood of North Africa, residents were delighted when an innovative AI-controlled system was installed to manage traffic flow and reduce congestion on their streets. However, they soon discovered a major problem with the system. Due to a programming error, the AI was unable to differentiate between "i.e." and "e.g." in its traffic announcements, leading to confusion and frustration among drivers. The issue persisted for months and became a long-lasting problem for the community, causing delays and accidents. Despite the efforts of local authorities and AI technicians, the issue remained unsolved, leaving residents to deal with the consequences of an AI control problem that had unexpected social consequences.
