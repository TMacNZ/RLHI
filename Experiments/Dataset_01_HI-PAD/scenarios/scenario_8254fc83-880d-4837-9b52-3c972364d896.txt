Not being able to provide adequate healthcare for their chosen family has caused a catastrophic situation for many families in the Middle East. With ongoing conflicts and limited resources, physical health concerns have become a major issue for families who cannot afford proper medical attention. Chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer are left untreated, leading to a decline in overall health and well-being. Children born with physical disabilities are not able to receive the necessary care and support, leaving them with lifelong challenges. The inability to address these health concerns has caused immense distress and pain for chosen families in the region, causing them to feel helpless and abandoned by their governments and communities.
