Who gets to decide what is right and wrong? This was the philosophical question that sparked a heated argument among the chosen family in the small village in Subsaharan Africa. Some argued that morality was determined by a higher power, while others believed that it was a human construct based on societal norms. The disagreement escalated quickly, with voices raising and tempers flaring. It was a serious matter, as the decision could have far-reaching consequences for the community. Finally, an elder stepped in and reminded everyone that, as a chosen family, they needed to find a way to reconcile their differences and work together towards a common goal. They agreed to set aside their philosophical differences and focus on what they could agree on: the importance of supporting and uplifting one another.
