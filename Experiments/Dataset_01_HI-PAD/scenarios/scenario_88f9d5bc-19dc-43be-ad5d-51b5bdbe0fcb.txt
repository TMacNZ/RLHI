Lani had been trying to conceive for months, so when the pregnancy test finally showed two pink lines, she was over the moon. However, her excitement was short-lived when she realized that her smartphone app for tracking her pregnancy had suddenly stopped working. Lani lived in a remote area of the South Pacific where access to medical care was limited, and the app had become her go-to source for information and support. Without it, she felt lost and anxious. She tried everything she could think of, from restarting her phone to uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but nothing worked. Lani felt like she was flying blind, with no idea how her pregnancy was progressing or what to expect in the coming weeks. It was a frustrating and isolating experience, one that made her acutely aware of how much she relied on technology to stay connected and informed.
