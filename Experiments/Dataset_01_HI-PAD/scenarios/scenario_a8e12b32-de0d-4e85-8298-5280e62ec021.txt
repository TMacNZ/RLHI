In a bustling city in Eurasia, a new AI system has been implemented to control the functions of an apartment building. The residents have noticed small changes in their daily routines, such as the temperature being adjusted automatically and the elevators being more efficient. However, a cultural issue has arisen as the AI system does not understand the cultural norms and customs of the diverse residents living in the building. For example, the system may turn off the music played during a religious ceremony or interrupt a family gathering in the common area. The residents have expressed their concerns to the building management, who are working with the AI developers to incorporate cultural sensitivity training into the system. Despite the minor inconvenience, the residents are optimistic about the potential benefits of the AI system and the improvements it can bring to their daily lives.
