As I sat at the kitchen table, I received a phone call from my dear Aunt in Europe. Her voice was trembling, and she was clearly distraught. She explained that my cousin, who I had grown up with, was in the hospital with a life-threatening illness. My heart sank as she spoke, and I could feel a lump forming in my throat. It was hard to imagine my cousin, who was always so full of life, struggling to stay alive. As I hung up the phone, I couldn't help but think about the fragility of life and how we often take it for granted. It made me realize that we should cherish the time we have with our loved ones and never take a single moment for granted.
