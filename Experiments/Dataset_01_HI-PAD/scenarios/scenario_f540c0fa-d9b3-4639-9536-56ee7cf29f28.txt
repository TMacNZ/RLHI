In a galaxy far away, an intergalactic war has been raging for centuries, and the fate of entire planets hangs in the balance. On one of these planets, located in the European region of the galaxy, a group of beings known as the Zorons have been characterized as the most technologically advanced species in the known universe. They possess knowledge and capabilities that could potentially end the war and save countless lives. However, the Zorons have a strict ethical code that forbids them from sharing their technology with any other species, even if it means the difference between life and death. Now, the leaders of the galaxy are faced with a life-threatening ethical dilemma: do they respect the Zorons' wishes and potentially let millions of innocent lives be lost, or do they go against their wishes and risk the consequences of violating their ethical code? The social implications of this decision are immense, and the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance.
