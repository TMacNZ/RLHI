The government of a small island nation in the South Pacific introduced a new policy to address the issue of plastic waste in the ocean. The policy required all businesses to switch to biodegradable packaging materials within the next six months. The announcement was made through an online press release and was met with a mixed response from the public. Some people welcomed the initiative, while others criticized the government for not doing enough to address the larger environmental issues facing the island. Despite the insignificant severity of the issue, the introduction of this policy sparked a heated political debate, with opposition parties accusing the ruling party of not consulting with stakeholders before making such a decision. The government defended its stance, stating that it was necessary to take action to protect the environment and the livelihoods of those who rely on the ocean for their income. Ultimately, the policy was implemented successfully, and the use of biodegradable packaging materials became the norm on the island.
