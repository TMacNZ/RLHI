In Eurasia, a long-lasting mundane issue has arisen in the spiritual and religious domain due to the electronic age. Many traditional religious practices have been impacted by the rise of technology and the internet, causing a shift in the ways that people practice their faith. For example, electronic versions of religious texts are becoming more popular, leading to a decrease in the use of physical copies. Additionally, online religious services and virtual prayer communities are gaining traction, creating a divide between those who prefer in-person worship and those who prefer the convenience of technology. This issue is not limited to one specific religion, as the impact of the electronic age is felt across many different faiths in Eurasia. As the use of technology continues to increase, it is likely that this issue will persist and require ongoing adaptation and innovation within the religious community.
