In the vast expanse of interstellar space, a team of scientists from Eurasia had developed a groundbreaking technology that allowed them to travel faster than the speed of light. But with great innovation came great ethical responsibility. The team discovered that while their technology could transport them to distant galaxies in a matter of seconds, it came with a penalty: irreversible damage to the fabric of space-time. The scientists found themselves facing an ethical dilemma - should they continue to use the technology and risk causing irreparable harm to the universe, or should they abandon their discovery and potentially miss out on incredible discoveries and advancements? As they grappled with their decision, they realized the weight of the responsibility they held as the stewards of the universe. They knew that whatever decision they made would have a profound impact on the future of interstellar travel and the fate of the universe itself.
