In a distant galaxy, there existed two planets, each with a thriving civilization. The inhabitants of one planet, Xandar, believed in a divine being who created the universe and bestowed upon them the gift of life. On the other planet, Zorath, the inhabitants did not believe in any higher power and instead relied on science and logic.

One day, a group of Xandarian explorers landed on Zorath and engaged in a discussion with the locals about their beliefs. The Xandarians were shocked to learn that the Zorathians did not believe in a divine being and instead believed that everything could be explained through scientific means.

As the debate continued, tensions rose, and both sides became more entrenched in their beliefs. The Xandarians argued that their belief in a higher power gave them a sense of purpose and meaning, while the Zorathians countered that their reliance on science allowed them to better understand the universe and make more informed decisions.

The argument continued for days, with neither side willing to give ground. As the days turned into weeks, the irreversibility of the situation became apparent. The two civilizations had become so entrenched in their beliefs that any hope of finding common ground was lost.

In the end, the Xandarians returned to their planet, saddened by the realization that they were not alone in the universe but would never be able to understand or accept the beliefs of the Zorathians. The Zorathians, meanwhile, continued to explore the universe through scientific means, secure in their conviction that they were on the right path. 

Back on Earth, a similar disagreement was occurring among religious and scientific communities in Europe. The comparison of beliefs and ideologies had led to an irreconcilable dispute, with each side convinced that they were right. The lesson that the Xandarians and Zorathians had learned was lost on the inhabitants of Earth.
