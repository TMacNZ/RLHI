In a small village nestled in the mountains of North Africa, a dangerous incident occurred that left the community shaken to its core. A group of children were playing near the edge of a steep cliff when one of them lost their footing and fell. The other children, in a state of panic, ran to get help. The village quickly mobilized a rescue team and after a few tense hours, the child was found alive and brought back to safety. However, the emotional toll of the incident was felt throughout the village for weeks to come. Parents were afraid to let their children out of their sight and the children themselves were haunted by the repeat of the incident in their minds. It was a stark reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of safety measures in the village.
