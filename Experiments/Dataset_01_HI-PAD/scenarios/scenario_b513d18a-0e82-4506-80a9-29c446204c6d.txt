Everyone was excited to spend time together and explore the beautiful islands. However, as the days went on, tensions began to rise within the crew. Petty arguments turned into full-blown fights, and soon enough, the family was divided into two camps. The once tight-knit group was now fractured, with each side refusing to speak to the other.

The beautiful scenery of the South Pacific was now marred by the emotional turmoil within the family. It was a mundane issue, but the impact on the family was severe and long-lasting, with relationships forever changed.
