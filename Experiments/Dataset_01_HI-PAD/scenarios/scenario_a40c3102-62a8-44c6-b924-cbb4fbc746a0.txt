In a small village in rural Europe, an alternative way of living has been adopted by a group of young activists. They have eschewed modern conveniences and instead are living off the land, using only sustainable materials and practices. However, their choice has proven to be dangerous as they have inadvertently caused an environmental issue. Their farming methods have led to an imbalance in the local ecosystem, causing an overpopulation of certain species and a depletion of others. The philosophical debate has arisen as to whether their alternative lifestyle is worth the potential harm it may cause to the environment. The villagers are torn between respecting the activists' choices and protecting the delicate balance of nature in their community.
