Occasionally, health concerns can disrupt the social dynamics of chosen families in Asia. For example, when one member of the family falls ill, it can put a strain on everyone else's schedules and priorities. If the illness is serious, it may require hospitalization, which means other family members may have to take time off work or school to care for their loved one. This can create financial and emotional stress, particularly if the family member who is sick is the primary breadwinner. Additionally, if the illness is contagious, it can disrupt social activities and gatherings, as the family may need to isolate themselves to prevent the spread of the illness. Despite these challenges, chosen families in Asia tend to rally around one another in times of need, offering support and care to ensure their loved ones get the help they need.
