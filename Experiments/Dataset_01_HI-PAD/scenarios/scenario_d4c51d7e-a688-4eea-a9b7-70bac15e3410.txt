Since moving to South America, my chosen family has been a source of comfort and support. However, we recently found ourselves in a minor legal conflict. One member of our group had a run-in with the law and we needed to band together to help them navigate the legal system. While the situation was stressful, our chosen family rallied around our friend and provided emotional and financial support. We spent countless hours researching local laws and connecting with lawyers who could help us. In the end, our friend was able to come out of the situation relatively unscathed, and we were all reminded of the strength and resilience of our chosen family.
