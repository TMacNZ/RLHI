In some parts of Asia, there is a growing suspicion among environmentalists that certain intellectual property laws may be irreversible damaging the natural world. As more and more companies seek to profit from the region's rich biodiversity by patenting traditional knowledge of medicinal plants and other resources, there is a growing concern that local communities may lose control over their own resources. This has led to some tense interpersonal conflicts between indigenous groups and companies who suspect that they may be violating intellectual property laws. Despite ongoing efforts to address these issues through policy and advocacy, there is still a long way to go in ensuring that the natural resources of Asia are protected for future generations.
