Asleep at the wheel of democracy, North America is dangerously close to spiraling into political unrest. The divide between the left and right has never been wider, with each side becoming more radicalized and entrenched in their beliefs. Political leaders seem to be asleep to the urgency of the situation, failing to bridge the gap and work towards a common goal. The result is a country teetering on the brink of chaos, with the potential for violence and conflict looming on the horizon. If we don't wake up and take action to address these deep-seated issues, North America may soon find itself in a state of turmoil that could take years to recover from.
