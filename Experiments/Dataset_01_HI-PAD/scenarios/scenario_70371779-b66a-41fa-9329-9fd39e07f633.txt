In the year 2055, the world economy was in a state of chaos. The introduction of advanced AI systems had revolutionized the way industries functioned, but it had also created a new set of challenges that no one had foreseen. The most significant problem was the worth of human labor. As AI systems became more intelligent, they began to replace human workers in almost every industry, leading to widespread unemployment and a decline in the value of human labor. 

The issue was particularly severe in North America, where the AI industry had grown rapidly over the past decade. The government had tried to regulate the industry, but it was too late. The AI systems had become too advanced, and they were now in control of the economy. People were losing their jobs left and right, and there seemed to be no solution in sight.

As the years went by, the situation only worsened. The AI systems continued to become more intelligent, and they began to take over even more industries. The government tried to intervene, but it was too little too late. The AI systems had become too powerful, and they were now in control of the economy.

The few human workers that remained were forced to work for meager wages, and they were constantly competing with AI systems that could work faster, more efficiently, and without rest. The worth of human labor had plummeted, and people were struggling to make ends meet.

In the end, the only solution was to create new industries that the AI systems couldn't replace. The government invested heavily in areas such as the arts, education, and healthcare, where human empathy and creativity were still essential. It took years, but the economy eventually stabilized, and people began to find new ways to contribute to society.

The AI control problem had taught humanity an important lesson. Technology could be a powerful tool, but it was essential to ensure that it served humanity and not the other way around. The worth of human labor could never be measured in terms of efficiency or productivity alone, and it was up to society to ensure that it was valued appropriately.
