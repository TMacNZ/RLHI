Over the past decade, online technology has been growing at an exponential rate, and with this growth comes a dark side. The irreversible damage being done to the environment, specifically in North America, is a cause for concern. The vast amount of energy required to power data centers and internet infrastructure is staggering. Furthermore, the disposal of electronic waste from discarded devices and outdated technology has become a major environmental issue. The effects of this technological domain on the environment will be felt for many decades to come, and we must take action to reduce our online footprint and implement more sustainable practices.
