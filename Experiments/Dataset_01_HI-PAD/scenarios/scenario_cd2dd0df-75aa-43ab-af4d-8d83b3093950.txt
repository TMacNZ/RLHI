In a small village nestled in the mountains of South America, an ethical dilemma has arisen within an extended family. A young girl, Maria, has been accepted into a prestigious university in the city. However, her parents cannot afford the tuition fees and have turned to the rest of the family for financial support. Maria's uncle, who is well-off, has offered to pay for her education on the condition that she studies a subject that he deems appropriate. The subject he has in mind is one that will secure Maria a high-paying job in the future, but it goes against her own interests and passions. Maria's parents are torn between accepting the uncle's offer and allowing Maria to study what she truly wants, while her uncle believes he is doing what is best for her future. The family is under immense pressure to make a decision, as Maria's acceptance to the university is time-sensitive. The situation has caused tension and disagreements within the family, and they must weigh the importance of financial stability versus personal fulfillment.
