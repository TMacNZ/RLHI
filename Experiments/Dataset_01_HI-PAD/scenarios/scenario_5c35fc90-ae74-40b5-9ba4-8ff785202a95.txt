In a small village in Subsaharan Africa, a financial crisis has hit hard. Families are struggling to put food on the table, and basic necessities like medicine are out of reach. The only solution seemed to be borrowing money from a local lender, who demanded high-interest rates and even required borrowers to wrap their homes as collateral. The practice worked for a while, until the lender suddenly passed away, leaving behind a trail of debt and chaos. With no one to take over the lending practice, families are now facing eviction and homelessness as their wrapped homes are being seized. The situation has become life-threatening, as many are forced to live on the streets without shelter or protection from the elements. In the face of this crisis, the community is left to ponder the philosophical questions of whether the pursuit of profit at the expense of human dignity and well-being is truly worth it.
