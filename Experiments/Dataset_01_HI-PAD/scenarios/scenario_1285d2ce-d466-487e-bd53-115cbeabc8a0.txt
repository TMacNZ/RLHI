In many parts of Subsaharan Africa, spiritual or religious beliefs play a significant role in shaping people's health behaviors. One such belief is that quite often, illnesses are not caused by natural factors but rather by supernatural ones. This perception can lead people to seek spiritual or religious interventions instead of conventional medical treatments when they fall sick. It is a typical scenario that can have serious consequences, especially in remote or disadvantaged communities where access to medical facilities is limited. In some cases, this can result in preventable deaths or the spread of infectious diseases as people fail to receive appropriate medical attention. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize and address the impact of spiritual or religious beliefs on health care-seeking behaviors in Subsaharan Africa to ensure that people receive appropriate medical care.
