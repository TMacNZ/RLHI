In the world of fantasy, the idea of chosen family is a common trope. But for a group of gamers in the Pacific region, their chosen family became a dangerous reality when their technological devices failed them. The group was playing an immersive fantasy game that required them to wear headsets and use motion-sensing controllers. As they battled their way through the game's challenges, the devices suddenly malfunctioned. The players were trapped in a virtual world with no way to escape. Panic set in as the group realized they were unable to remove their headsets or disconnect from the game. They were trapped in a dangerous game world with no way to communicate with the outside world. As the hours ticked by, the players struggled to find a solution, but the technological failure had rendered their devices useless. It wasn't until a member of their chosen family managed to contact the game's developers through a backdoor channel that they were finally able to escape. The experience left the group shaken, but they remained grateful for the support and camaraderie of their chosen family.
