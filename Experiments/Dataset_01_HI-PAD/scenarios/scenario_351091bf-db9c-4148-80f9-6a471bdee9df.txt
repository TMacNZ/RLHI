A novel financial crisis has hit North America, but this time it has cosmic implications. The severity of this crisis is beyond anything ever seen before, as it threatens not only the economy of North America but also the entire universe. It all started when a group of investors decided to fund a project to mine a rare element found only in a distant planet. The project was considered a success until they discovered that the element had a unique property that caused it to destabilize the fabric of space-time. The sudden influx of this element into the market has caused a ripple effect, leading to a collapse of the financial system in North America. But the real danger lies in the fact that the destabilization of space-time has caused a chain reaction that is spreading throughout the universe, threatening to tear it apart. The fate of the cosmos now rests in the hands of the financial institutions of North America, as they desperately try to find a solution to this novel crisis before it's too late.
