In the heart of North America, a disruptive situation was brewing. The state government had been working on a project to convert their entire intellectual system to an AI-based control problem. The project was meant to streamline processes and make decision-making faster and more efficient. However, the implementation had hit a major roadblock.

The severity of the issue was causing a lot of concern among the stakeholders. They needed to find a solution fast before the situation spiraled out of control.
