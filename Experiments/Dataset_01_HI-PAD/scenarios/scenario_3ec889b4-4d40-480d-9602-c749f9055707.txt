In the South Pacific, a seemingly normal environmental issue has become an annoyance for the legal system due to its cosmic implications. The issue at hand is the pollution caused by an abandoned spaceship that crashed into the ocean. The wreckage has been leaking toxic chemicals into the water, which has led to a decline in marine life and has affected the livelihoods of local fishermen. However, what makes this situation unique is that the spaceship is not from Earth. It was discovered to be from a distant planet in another galaxy. This has caused debates among scientists and government officials as to who has jurisdiction over the issue and how to properly address it. The legal system is struggling to find a solution that not only addresses the environmental impact but also considers the potential cosmic consequences of intervening with the spaceship.
