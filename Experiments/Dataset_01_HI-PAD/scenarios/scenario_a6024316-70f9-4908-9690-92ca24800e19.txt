In a small village in Subsaharan Africa, the locals had been relying on coal as their primary source of fuel for generations. However, with the recent discovery of a new interstellar energy source, the rest of the world had moved on to more advanced and sustainable forms of energy. The village was now facing a social challenge as they struggled to keep up with the rest of the world, still relying on coal for their daily needs. The insignificant severity of the issue made it hard for them to receive aid or funding to transition to a new source of energy. However, the community banded together and started exploring alternative energy sources, such as solar power and wind turbines. With time and effort, they were able to successfully transition away from coal and embrace a more sustainable future.
