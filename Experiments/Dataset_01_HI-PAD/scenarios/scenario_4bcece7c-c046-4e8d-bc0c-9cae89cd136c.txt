In the year 2150, the Intergalactic Games were held in South America. It was a prestigious event where athletes from various planets competed against each other. The final event was the marathon, and the crowd cheered as the runners approached the finish line. However, as the first runner crossed the finish line, it was discovered that they had cheated by taking performance-enhancing drugs. The judges were faced with a difficult ethical dilemma. Should they disqualify the winner and award the medal to the second-place runner, who had trained hard without any enhancements? Or should they let the winner keep the medal, as they had still run the race and won, even if it was not fair? The decision had to be made quickly, as the life of the second-place runner was at stake. If they were not awarded the medal, they would lose all future funding and sponsorship. It was a social dilemma that could have severe consequences for the athletes and their families.
