The Johnson family had always been known for their perfect set of pearly whites. They religiously brushed twice a day, flossed, and visited the dentist every six months. However, one fateful day, their world came crashing down. Mr. Johnson, a nuclear engineer, had been working on a top-secret project at the power plant. Suddenly, there was a catastrophic failure, and radiation leaked out into the surrounding area, including the Johnsons' home. As a result, the entire family's teeth began falling out, one by one. The radiation had weakened their enamel to the point where even the slightest pressure caused their teeth to crumble. The family was devastated and had no choice but to resort to dentures. Mrs. Johnson couldn't help but wonder if this was the universe's way of teaching them a philosophical lesson about the fragility of life.
