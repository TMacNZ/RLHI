As a solar panel technician working in Subsaharan Africa, the scorching sun can be both a blessing and a curse. While the sun provides the necessary energy to power homes and businesses, it also poses a constant annoyance for those working outdoors. The intense heat can quickly become unbearable, making it difficult to focus and complete tasks efficiently. Despite the mundane nature of the issue, it can have a significant impact on productivity and the overall success of the job. Technicians must take precautions such as staying hydrated and taking breaks in the shade to prevent heat exhaustion and ensure their safety.
