Samantha, a Democrat, was visiting her friend in South Asia. She couldn't help but notice that her friend was constantly coughing and wheezing. Samantha was annoyed that her friend didn't take her health seriously. She knew that air pollution was a major health concern in the region, and she urged her friend to take precautions. Samantha explained that air pollution could cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and even cancer. She suggested that her friend wear a mask when outside and invest in an air purifier for their home. Samantha's friend was grateful for the advice and promised to take better care of her health.
