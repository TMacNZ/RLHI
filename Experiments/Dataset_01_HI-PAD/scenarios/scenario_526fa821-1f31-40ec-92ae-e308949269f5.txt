Nearly a hundred years after the formation of the Space Agency, the South Pacific region has experienced a wave of political unrest. Despite its seemingly insignificant impact in the grand scheme of things, the unrest has caused a stir within the cosmic and universal community. The space agency, which operates globally, has been closely monitoring the situation and has expressed concern over the potential for further escalation. The region has long been considered a peaceful and stable part of the world, making the recent events all the more surprising. As tensions continue to rise, the space agency has been working with local authorities to try and find a resolution to the situation before it spirals out of control.
