It turned out that a legal dispute had arisen concerning the ownership of a valuable resource that was crucial for the survival of the Zaran people. The dispute had escalated into a full-blown conflict, pitting neighbor against neighbor and tribe against tribe. The Zaran leaders were in a dilemma, unsure of how to resolve the crisis without causing irreparable damage to their society's attribute of peaceful coexistence. As the conflict raged on, the Zaran people could only watch in despair, wondering if their once harmonious society would ever be the same again.
