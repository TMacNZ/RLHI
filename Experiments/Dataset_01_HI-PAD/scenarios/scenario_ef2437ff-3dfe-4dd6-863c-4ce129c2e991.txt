Last night, my friends and I got into a minor disagreement over a video we were watching. We were at my apartment in London, England, and had decided to have a movie night. One of my friends suggested we watch a viral video that had been making the rounds on social media. However, as the video played, some of us found it to be offensive and not funny at all. One friend was particularly vocal about her dislike for the video, while another defended it, saying that it was just harmless fun. We ended up having a brief argument about the video, but ultimately decided to switch to a different movie to avoid any further tension. Even though it was a minor disagreement, it made me realize how important it is to be mindful of others' feelings and opinions, even when it comes to something as seemingly insignificant as a video.
