Nisha and Rahul were sitting in their modern apartment in Mumbai, enjoying the view of the city skyline from their balcony. As they sipped on their evening tea, they noticed that their internet connection was acting up. The connection had been inconsistent for the past few days, but today it seemed particularly slow.

Rahul, who was an IT professional, immediately checked the modem and router, but everything seemed to be in order. He decided to call the service provider to get to the bottom of the issue. After being on hold for a few minutes, he finally reached a customer service representative, who informed him that there was a technical issue in the area and that the engineers were working on resolving it.

Nisha and Rahul were relieved to hear that it was just a minor technological failure, and that it would be resolved soon. They decided to spend their evening doing something offline and ended up playing board games together. As they played, they realized that they had been neglecting their interpersonal relationship due to their busy work schedules and reliance on technology.

The internet outage turned out to be a blessing in disguise for the couple, as it gave them the opportunity to reconnect and spend quality time together. They made a pact to set aside a few hours each week for offline activities like board games, cooking together, and going for walks.

As they cuddled up on the couch, watching the sunset, Nisha and Rahul realized that sometimes a minor technological failure could have a major impact on their lives, reminding them of the importance of interpersonal connections in this modern world.
