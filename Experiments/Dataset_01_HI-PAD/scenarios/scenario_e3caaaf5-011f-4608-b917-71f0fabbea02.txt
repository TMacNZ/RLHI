A critical social challenge has emerged in Eurasia, where a disturbing pattern of discrimination and exclusion is on the rise. Communities are being divided along ethnic and religious lines, as intolerance and bigotry spread like wildfire. This is not just a local issue, but a global concern, as the impact of this social division can be felt far beyond the region. The need for urgent action to address this problem cannot be overstated, as failure to do so will only lead to further polarization and conflict. It is up to all of us to stand up against discrimination and work towards a more inclusive and tolerant society, both in Eurasia and around the world.
