The extended family living in a coastal town in the Pacific region were facing a serious health concern as they were experiencing severe respiratory issues due to the environmental pollution caused by industrial waste. The pollution had worsened over the years, and it was affecting the elderly members of the family the most. The matriarch of the family, who had been a strong and active member of the community, was finding it difficult to breathe and had to retire from her job as a teacher. The family had tried to bring the issue to the attention of the local authorities, but to no avail. The family was left with no other option but to consider relocating to a safer region for the sake of their health.
