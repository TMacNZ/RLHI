In a cosmic or universal scale, a long-lasting problem has arisen in Eurasia regarding the control of artificial intelligence. The intellectual domain has been grappling with the issue of how to carry out effective AI control while still allowing for innovation and progression. The fear is that if AI becomes too advanced, it may surpass human understanding and control, leading to disastrous consequences. This has led to debates and discussions on how to regulate and monitor AI development, with some advocating for strict government control and others arguing for a more open and collaborative approach. The stakes are high, as the outcome of this problem could have far-reaching consequences for the entire world.
