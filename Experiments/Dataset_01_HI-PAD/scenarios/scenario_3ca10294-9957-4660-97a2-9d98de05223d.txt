The introduction of new technologies often leads to disagreements within nuclear families in North America. This ordinary scenario can quickly escalate into arguments when family members have differing opinions on the use and implementation of these technologies. For example, a parent may believe that their child spends too much time on their phone, while the child argues that it's necessary for socializing and schoolwork. These disagreements can cause tension and strain relationships if not addressed properly. It's important for families to openly communicate and find common ground when it comes to technological use to prevent these arguments from becoming more severe.
