In a distant corner of the universe, in the Eurasian region of a planet called Xalaxia, an afternoon turned into chaos as a disruptive conflict erupted in the educational domain. The two dominant factions on the planet, the Xalaxians and the Vortians, had been at odds for centuries, but tensions had been escalating in recent years. As the sun beat down on the campus of the prestigious Xalaxian Academy, a group of Vortian students clashed with their Xalaxian counterparts, quickly turning a peaceful afternoon into a violent and dangerous situation. The academy's faculty struggled to contain the situation as the conflict spilled into classrooms, disrupting lectures and endangering the lives of innocent students. As the two factions battled, it became clear that the conflict was far from over and that the educational domain of Xalaxia was in serious danger.
