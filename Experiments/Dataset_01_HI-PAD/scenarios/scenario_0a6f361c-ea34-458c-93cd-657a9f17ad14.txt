In the year 2050, the galactic community was hit with a severe financial crisis that threatened to expand and cripple the entire universe. The severity of the situation was felt most acutely in the Middle East, where the crisis began to take on a spiritual and religious dimension. The leaders of the major religions in the region came together to address the crisis, but soon found themselves at odds with one another. The situation was made worse by the fact that many of the smaller, less powerful religious groups were being left out of the conversation entirely. As the crisis continued to worsen, it became clear that a new approach was needed. The galactic community began to work together to develop a new financial system that would be more equitable and inclusive, and that would help to prevent similar crises from happening in the future. The leaders of the major religions in the Middle East were finally able to come together and support this new system, which helped to restore a sense of hope and unity to the region.
