In the Eurasian region, a frequent and dangerous problem has arisen with regards to AI control in political domains. As more and more countries implement AI systems into their political processes, concerns have been raised about the potential for these systems to manipulate and control the outcomes of elections and decision-making processes. This has led to a growing need for regulation and oversight of AI systems in political domains, as well as increased education and awareness among the public and policymakers about the potential risks involved. Failure to address this issue could have severe consequences for the future of democracy and political stability in the region, highlighting the urgent need for action.
