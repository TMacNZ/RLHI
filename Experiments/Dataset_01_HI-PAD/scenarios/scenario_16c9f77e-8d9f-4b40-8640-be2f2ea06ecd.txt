Differently from previous times of political turmoil, the current unrest in Eurasia has an irreversible impact on the environment. The protests, demonstrations, and clashes between different factions have led to widespread destruction of natural habitats and ecosystems. The once-pristine forests and rivers have been polluted with toxic waste, and the air quality has deteriorated to dangerous levels. The global community is alarmed by the situation, as the irreversible damage to the environment will have far-reaching consequences beyond the borders of Eurasia. The leaders of the affected countries are urged to prioritize the protection of the environment and take immediate action to restore the damage caused by the political unrest.
