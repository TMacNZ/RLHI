In the year 2076, humanity has finally achieved interstellar travel, with colonies established on planets beyond our solar system. However, a catastrophic event has occurred on the South Asian colony of New Delhi. A deadly virus has spread rapidly through the population, with a mortality rate of 99.9%. The virus seems to affect all races and ages except those with a certain genetic mutation found predominantly in the local population. This has led to a social challenge as the mutated individuals are now the only hope for the survival of the colony. With interstellar travel still in its infancy, the resources and medical supplies needed to combat the virus are limited, and the mutated individuals are being targeted by those who believe they hold the key to their own survival. As tensions rise, the colony faces a dilemma of how to ensure the survival of all, except without sacrificing the few for the many.
