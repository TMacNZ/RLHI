As a college student in the bustling city of Dubai, Ahmed relied on his trusty cycle to get around town. One afternoon, while on his way to class, he was cycling down a busy street when a car swerved into his lane. Ahmed tried to avoid the car but ended up losing control of his cycle and crashing onto the pavement. Thankfully, he only suffered a few scrapes and bruises, but his cycle was badly damaged. Without his cycle, Ahmed was forced to spend more money on public transportation, cutting into his already tight budget. He learned the hard way that cycling in the city can be dangerous, and now he takes extra precautions to ensure his safety on the road.
