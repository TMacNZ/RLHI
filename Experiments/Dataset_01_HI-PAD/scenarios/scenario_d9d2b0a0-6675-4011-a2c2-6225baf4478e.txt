In a small neighborhood in North Africa, a group of pregnant women are becoming increasingly annoyed with the political unrest that is causing environmental issues in their community. The constant protests and clashes between opposing groups have led to the destruction of local businesses and a lack of resources. This has resulted in a lack of access to clean water and air pollution, which is causing health issues for the pregnant women and their unborn children. The women have tried to voice their concerns to local officials, but their pleas have been ignored. As the political unrest continues, the pregnant women are left feeling helpless and anxious about the future of their community and the health of their children.
