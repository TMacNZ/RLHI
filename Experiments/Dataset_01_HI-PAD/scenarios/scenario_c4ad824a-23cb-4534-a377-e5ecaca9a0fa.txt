Rajesh, a bright and hardworking student from a small village in South Asia, had always dreamed of pursuing higher education to break the cycle of poverty his family had been trapped in for generations. He had been overjoyed when he received a full scholarship to study at a prestigious university in the city. However, his dreams were shattered when he was involved in a severe accident on his way to the campus. The accident left him with permanent injuries that made it impossible for him to continue his studies or work to support his family. The long-lasting consequences of the accident not only robbed him of his ability to pursue his dreams but also left his family struggling to make ends meet without his contribution. The economic impact of the accident on Rajesh's family was devastating, forcing them to sell their meager possessions to pay for his medical care and daily expenses. The scholarship that had once brought him hope for a better future turned into a painful reminder of what he had lost.
