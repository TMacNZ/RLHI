In many parts of Asia, extended family is highly valued and the responsibility to care for elderly members is considered a duty. However, an ethical dilemma arises when one family member has a reason to believe that their elderly relative is being mistreated or neglected by another family member. This can lead to a long-lasting and contentious situation, as the family member with concerns must navigate cultural norms and philosophical beliefs about family loyalty and respect while also feeling a moral obligation to ensure the well-being of their loved one. It becomes a philosophical question of what is the right thing to do in this situation, balancing the duty to family with the duty to protect the vulnerable.
