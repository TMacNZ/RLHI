In a fantasy world, where politics are just as cutthroat as in the real world, a catastrophic technological failure occurred. The online system used for voting and tallying election results crashed, leaving North America in chaos. People were unsure who had won the election, and accusations of tampering began to fly. Riots broke out in major cities as citizens demanded answers and a fair election. The leaders of each party scrambled to try and find a solution, but the damage had already been done. The fantasy world was plunged into uncertainty and mistrust, and it would take years to rebuild the trust of the citizens in the political system.
