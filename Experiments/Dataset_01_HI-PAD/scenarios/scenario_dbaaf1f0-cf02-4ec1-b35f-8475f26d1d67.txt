In the year 2256, the Interstellar Council passed a controversial law that required all planets within their jurisdiction to grade their citizens based on their contribution to society. The grade would determine a person's access to basic necessities like food, shelter, and medical care, as well as their eligibility for higher education and employment opportunities. The law, while seemingly fair on the surface, posed a dangerous threat to the citizens of South America, a region where poverty and inequality ran rampant. The government, in an attempt to comply with the law, began implementing a system that favored the wealthy and privileged, while leaving the poor and marginalized to suffer. This created an ethical dilemma for the political leaders of the region, who had to choose between following the law and perpetuating a system of injustice, or challenging the law and potentially facing consequences from the Interstellar Council. As tensions rose, protests erupted on the streets, and the fate of the citizens of South America hung in the balance.
