The family had just arrived in Europe for their summer vacation. They were excited to explore new places and try out the local cuisine. However, the mother was on a strict diet and couldn't indulge in the delicious food that was available. This became quite an annoyance for the rest of the family as they couldn't enjoy their meals without feeling guilty or worrying about the mother's dietary restrictions. The family tried their best to accommodate the mother's diet by searching for restaurants that offered healthy options, but it was difficult to find something that suited everyone's taste buds. As a result, the family had to compromise and settle for less exciting meals than they had hoped for. Despite the annoyance, the family tried to make the best of the situation and enjoy their vacation together.
