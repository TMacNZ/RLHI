In South Asia, a nuclear family had a disruptive argument that turned physical over a disagreement about a citizen. The argument was between the father and the son, who had differing opinions about a prominent citizen in their community. The father believed that the citizen was corrupt and had caused harm to their community, while the son argued that the citizen had done a lot of good and had helped many people. As the argument escalated, the son became increasingly angry and began to push his father. The father, in turn, responded with physical aggression, resulting in a physical altercation between the two. The argument left the family divided and tensions high, with each member taking sides and refusing to back down. The family was left to grapple with the aftermath of the disagreement and the physical altercation, and it would take time and effort for them to come back together and resolve their differences.
