As humanity expanded beyond the boundaries of the Milky Way, a dangerous physical health concern emerged. It was discovered that exposure to the radiation emanating from the distant stars and galaxies could cause irreparable damage to the human body. The Middle East, a region with a large intergalactic population, was hit the hardest by this scale of danger. The governments of the affected countries scrambled to take action, investing heavily in technology and medical research to find a solution. Some people chose to leave the region altogether, fleeing to planets with less dangerous radiation levels. Despite the challenges, the people of the Middle East remained resilient, determined to find a way to overcome this intergalactic health crisis.
