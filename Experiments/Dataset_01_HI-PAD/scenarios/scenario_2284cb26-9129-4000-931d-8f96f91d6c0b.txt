John and Peter have been friends since college, but their relationship has been strained lately due to their different political views. John is a staunch conservative, while Peter is a progressive liberal. They have had several heated arguments about politics in the past, but nothing like what happened on this particular day.

The two friends met up at a café in downtown London, where they usually catch up on life and discuss politics. As they ordered their coffee, John brought up a controversial political issue that he knew would spark a debate. Peter, who was tired of arguing with John, tried to change the subject, but John persisted.

Their conversation quickly escalated into a heated argument, with both men raising their voices and becoming increasingly agitated. Passersby looked on in disbelief as the argument grew more and more intense.

Suddenly, John stood up from his chair and started shouting at Peter. He accused Peter of being unpatriotic and of not caring about the country's future. Peter, feeling attacked, stood up as well and started shouting back at John, calling him a fascist and a bigot.

The argument became so intense that the café owner had to intervene and ask them to leave. The two friends stormed out of the café, still shouting at each other on the street. Their disagreement had become dangerous, not only for themselves but for those around them.

As they walked away from the café, John and Peter realized that their friendship might never be the same again. They had always respected each other's opinions, even when they disagreed, but this argument had crossed a line. They both felt hurt and betrayed, and they knew that it would take a lot of work to repair their relationship.
