Apparently, there was a disagreement between two tech companies in the state over a patent infringement issue. One company claimed that the other had used their technology without permission, while the other argued that their product was completely different. The disagreement quickly escalated into an argument, with both sides refusing to back down. The situation became tense, with each company threatening legal action against the other. The state government intervened to try and mediate the situation, calling for a round-table discussion between the two companies. After several hours of discussion, both companies agreed to a compromise, with the accused company agreeing to pay a licensing fee for the use of the technology. The situation was resolved, but not without some degree of bad blood between the two companies.
