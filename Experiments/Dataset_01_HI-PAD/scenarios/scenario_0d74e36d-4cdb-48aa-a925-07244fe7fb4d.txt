In South Asia, natural disasters are a common occurrence. The region is prone to cyclones, floods, and earthquakes. However, in recent years, the severity and frequency of these natural disasters have increased, posing a dangerous threat to the people and the environment. In response to these events, professionals and organizations have come together to create disaster management plans, but even the best plans can only do so much. As a result, gestures of support and aid from neighboring countries and international organizations are crucial. The damage caused by these disasters can be devastating, leaving people and communities in dire need of assistance. The environment also suffers, with ecosystems disrupted and wildlife displaced. It is a sobering reminder of the fragility of our planet and the need for global collaboration to tackle this issue.
