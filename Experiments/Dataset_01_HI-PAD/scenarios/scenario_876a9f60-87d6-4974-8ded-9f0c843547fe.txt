In the vast expanse of the South Pacific, a catastrophic event had taken place that would forever alter the intergalactic economy. It all began with the failure of a highly advanced organic technology that was responsible for the cultivation of a rare and valuable resource found only in that region of space. The failure was irreversible, and the technology could not be repaired or replaced, leaving the resource inaccessible to the larger intergalactic community. As a result, the economy of many planets and civilizations was severely impacted, leading to widespread poverty and unrest. Attempts were made to find a solution, but the organic technology was so advanced that no one had the knowledge or expertise to fix it. The once-thriving intergalactic trade in the South Pacific was now in shambles, and the impact of the technological failure would be felt for generations to come.
