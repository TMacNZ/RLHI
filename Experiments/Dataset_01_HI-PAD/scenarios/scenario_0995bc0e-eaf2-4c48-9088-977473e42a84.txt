In the small North African community of El Hamma, residents are growing increasingly frustrated with the constant presence of trash in their neighborhood. The streets are littered with plastic bags, food wrappers, and other debris, creating an eyesore that is difficult to ignore. Not only is the garbage an annoyance, but it also poses a health concern for residents. The accumulation of trash attracts rats and other pests, which can spread disease and contaminate the local water supply. Despite efforts from local officials to address the issue, many residents are calling for more action to be taken to clean up the community and prevent future littering. As they look out their windows or walk down the street, they can't help but feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of trash that surrounds them.
