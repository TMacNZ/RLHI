The Sharma family, consisting of parents Rohit and Priya and their two children, had always been avid readers and regular visitors of their local library. However, a disagreement arose when Rohit, a nuclear physicist, began to express his support for the development of nuclear weapons in South Asia. Priya, a social activist, vehemently opposed this idea and argued that it would only lead to irreversible destruction and loss of innocent lives. The argument soon escalated, with both parents refusing to back down from their positions. The tension at home was palpable, with the children caught in the middle of their parents' disagreement. As the days passed, the family's visits to the library became less frequent, with Rohit and Priya avoiding each other's company. The once harmonious household was now plagued by the irreconcilable differences between the parents, leaving the children feeling anxious and helpless.
