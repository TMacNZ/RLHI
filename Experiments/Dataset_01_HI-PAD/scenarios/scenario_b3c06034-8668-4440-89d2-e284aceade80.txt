In a far-off galaxy, in the depths of the universe, a catastrophic event occurred that threatened the entire intergalactic community. The floor of the central hub, where all the important meetings took place, had suddenly collapsed. This hub was the center of all cultural exchange and diplomatic relations for every planet in the region. The collapse of the floor meant that all communication between the planets had been cut off. The region affected was Asia, where many planets relied on this hub to maintain cultural harmony and economic stability. The mundane issue of a faulty floor had turned into a disaster of epic proportions. The intergalactic council had to act quickly and send their best engineers to fix the problem before it was too late. The entire region of Asia was on the brink of chaos and it was up to the council to ensure that peace was restored.
