In the far reaches of the South Pacific lies a technologically-advanced civilization that has faced a critical social challenge. Their intergalactic communication system, which relies on a pair of powerful satellites to connect them to the rest of the universe, has malfunctioned. The pair of satellites that were once the pride of their civilization have gone dark. The loss of this technological backbone has caused widespread panic and chaos among the people, who fear that they are now cut off from the rest of the galaxy forever. The leaders of the civilization have called for urgent action to repair the satellites and restore communication before it's too late. The fate of an entire civilization hangs in the balance, and time is running out.
