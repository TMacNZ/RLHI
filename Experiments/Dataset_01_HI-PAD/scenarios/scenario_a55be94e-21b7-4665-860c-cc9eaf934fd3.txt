Living in a bustling city in Asia, the Lee family relied heavily on public transportation to commute to work and school. But one day, they received news that a nearby nuclear power plant had malfunctioned, releasing dangerous levels of radiation into the air and water. The government urged residents to evacuate the area immediately, but the Lees were unable to secure transportation out of the city. As they searched for a way to escape, they watched in horror as the streets became chaotic and overcrowded with panicked citizens. With each passing moment, the threat to their lives grew more severe. The family frantically searched for any means of transportation, but every option seemed to be either unavailable or too dangerous to risk. As the air grew thick with radiation, the Lees knew that their only chance of survival was to find a way out of the city before it was too late.
