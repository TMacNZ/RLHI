As the field of artificial intelligence continued to rapidly expand, competitive pressures began to mount among research teams in the Middle East. Each team hoped to be the first to develop the most advanced AI system, and the race was on. While the competition was certainly motivating, it also raised philosophical questions about the nature of AI control. Who would be responsible for ensuring that these powerful machines were used ethically and responsibly? Would it be the individual teams, or some larger governing body? As the stakes grew higher and the competition more intense, these questions became increasingly urgent. Some researchers worried that the rush to develop ever-more-advanced AI was blinding them to the potential dangers of these systems, and that there was a real risk of losing control of the technology altogether. Despite these concerns, the competitive spirit continued to drive the researchers forward, as they sought to make their mark on the rapidly-evolving landscape of AI research in the Middle East.
