The maker movement had gained significant momentum in the Pacific region, with a growing number of individuals using their creativity and technical skills to design and build their own products. However, a critical social challenge had arisen as a result of this trend. The national government had failed to regulate the production and distribution of these products, which had led to a proliferation of counterfeit and substandard goods in the market. These products were not only a threat to consumers' safety and well-being, but they also posed a significant challenge to local businesses that were struggling to compete with the low-priced, low-quality products flooding the market. The federal government was now facing mounting pressure to address this issue and find a way to regulate the maker movement without stifling innovation and creativity.
