The reader sat in their living room, scrolling through the news on their tablet. Suddenly, the device flickered and went black. After a few moments of confusion, they realized that it was irreversibly broken. This might not have been such a big deal, except that the reader was the only member of their extended family who had access to news from outside of Eurasia. With this technological failure, they were cut off from the world beyond their region. To make matters worse, the reader was a political journalist who relied on their tablet to stay up-to-date on current events. Without it, they were unable to report on the latest developments and provide their audience with the information they needed to stay informed. The family tried to find a replacement, but nothing was available that would allow the reader to access the same breadth of news and information. The technological failure had a devastating impact on both the reader and the wider community who relied on their reporting.
