In the era of online communication, an ethical dilemma has arisen beside the rise of technological advancements. With the internet being a global platform, it has become increasingly difficult to regulate online behavior and prevent long-lasting consequences. In Eurasia, this issue has become even more pronounced, as cultural differences and varying ethical standards make it difficult to enforce universal rules. From hate speech and cyberbullying to the spread of false information, unethical online behavior has become a major concern. As the internet continues to expand and evolve, it is imperative to address this issue and create a safer and more ethical online environment for all users.
