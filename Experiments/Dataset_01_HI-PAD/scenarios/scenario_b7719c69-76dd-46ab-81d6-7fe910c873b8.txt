In today's world, there is a growing divide between those who identify as conservative and those who do not. This divide is not limited to one country or region, but rather a global issue that is particularly prevalent in North America. The severity of this social challenge may not be extreme, but it has certainly become ordinary in our daily lives. The philosophical domain of this issue is rooted in differing beliefs regarding the role of government, personal freedoms, and social values. As this split continues to widen, it is important for individuals on both sides to engage in thoughtful discourse and seek understanding in order to bridge the gap and find common ground.
