The tension between two rival student groups in a South Asian university had been brewing for weeks. In an effort to ease the tension, the university administration decided to invite both groups to a peace dialogue. The invitation was sent out to the leaders of the groups, but what was meant to be a peaceful meeting turned into a violent clash that left several students injured. The situation quickly escalated and soon the entire university was engulfed in the conflict. The police were called in to restore order, but it was too late. The violence had spread beyond the university, with clashes erupting in other parts of the city as well. The invite that was meant to bring peace to the campus had instead sparked a dangerous conflict, leaving everyone wondering how things had gone so wrong.
