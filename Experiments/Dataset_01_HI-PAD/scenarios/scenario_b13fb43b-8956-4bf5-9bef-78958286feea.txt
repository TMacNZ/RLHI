Lena had been married to her husband for 10 years, and while she loved him dearly, there were times when he drove her crazy. One of those times was when their finances were in crisis. Living in Eurasia, they had always struggled to make ends meet, but the latest economic downturn had hit them hard. Lena had been scrimping and saving, but her husband seemed oblivious to their financial woes. He continued to spend money on unnecessary things, insisting that they needed them. Lena was at her wit's end, frustrated and annoyed that her husband wasn't taking their financial situation seriously. She knew they needed to have a serious conversation, but she didn't want to start a fight. Instead, she decided to sit down with him and go over their expenses together, hoping that he would see the reality of their situation and start making changes.
