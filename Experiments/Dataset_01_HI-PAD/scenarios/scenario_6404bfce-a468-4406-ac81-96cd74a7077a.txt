It was a dark and tumultuous time in Subsaharan Africa, as political unrest swept across the region. The government was corrupt, and the people were suffering. The educational domain was particularly hard hit, with schools closing down and teachers fleeing for their lives. Children were left without an education, and the future looked bleak. The situation was so severe that a regional or statewide raise was needed, but with the catastrophic severity of the situation, it would take a herculean effort to make a difference. The international community rallied together to provide aid and support, but it was a long and difficult road ahead. Despite the challenges, there was hope that with enough determination and resources, the situation could be turned around and the children of Subsaharan Africa could receive the education they deserved.
