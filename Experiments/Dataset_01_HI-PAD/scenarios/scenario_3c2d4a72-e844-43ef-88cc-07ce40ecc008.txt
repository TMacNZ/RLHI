The South Pacific region is facing a major social challenge that could have irreversible consequences. The physical domain has been affected and the locals are struggling to cope. Due to climate change, the sea level has risen significantly, causing widespread flooding and erosion of the coastlines. As a result, many communities have been displaced, and their homes and livelihoods destroyed. The situation is further exacerbated by the lack of resources and funding to support those affected. The global community must come together to address this issue and provide aid to the South Pacific region before it's too late.
