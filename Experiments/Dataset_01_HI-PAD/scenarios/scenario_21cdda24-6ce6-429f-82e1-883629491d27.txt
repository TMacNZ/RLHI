In a small town in South America, a nuclear family was struggling to make ends meet. The father was an economist who had lost his job due to the economic crisis in the country. As the family's financial situation worsened, tensions began to rise within the household. The father's frustration and anger began to manifest into violent outbursts towards his wife and children. The mother and children lived in constant fear, never knowing when the next outburst would occur. The cultural norms of the community made it difficult for the mother to seek help, as it was seen as shameful to publicly admit that there was violence in the home. The situation grew more dangerous by the day, and the family was trapped in a cycle of violence that seemed impossible to break.
