In a small village in rural Asia, a dangerous belief has taken hold among an extended family. They believe that education is a waste of time and resources, and that children should instead focus on helping with the family business. Despite the efforts of local educators and community leaders, the family remains steadfast in their belief. The situation has become even more dire as the family's business involves the use of heavy machinery, which poses a serious risk to the children who are forced to work alongside their parents. Persuading the family to allow their children to attend school has become a top priority for the community, as the safety and well-being of the children are at stake.
