In an intergalactic future, Europe was a hub for technological advancement and innovation. However, working conditions in the factories that produced these cutting-edge technologies were dire. Workers were often overworked and underpaid, with little regard for their safety. This eventually led to a violent conflict between the workers and the wealthy elite who owned the factories. The severity of the situation became irreversible as the workers began to use the very technologies they produced as weapons against their oppressors. The conflict quickly spread throughout Europe and threatened to destabilize the entire intergalactic region. Despite efforts to quell the violence, the damage had already been done and the once-thriving technological industry in Europe was left in ruins.
