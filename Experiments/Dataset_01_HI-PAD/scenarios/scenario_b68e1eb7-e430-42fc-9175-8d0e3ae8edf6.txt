In the vast expanse of interstellar space, a serious disagreement has arisen between the Pacific Academy and their rival, the Galactic Institute of Honors. The dispute centers on the definition of honor in the context of space exploration. The Pacific Academy's educators argue that honor is best displayed through peaceful exploration and scientific discovery, while the Galactic Institute of Honors insists that honor is proven through conquest and domination of new worlds. Tensions have reached a boiling point, with both sides refusing to back down. As the argument threatens to spill over into open conflict, the fate of interstellar education hangs in the balance. It is up to the leaders of both institutions to find a way to resolve this disagreement before it tears apart the very fabric of the academic community.
