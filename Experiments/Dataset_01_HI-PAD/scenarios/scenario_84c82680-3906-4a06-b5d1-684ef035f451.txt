In the distant future, humanity had expanded its reach beyond the confines of Earth and established colonies on various planets throughout the galaxy. One of these colonies, located in the Asian sector of space, was facing an unexpected financial crisis. The colony's economy had been heavily reliant on a revolutionary technological breakthrough that allowed for the efficient mining and extraction of valuable resources from nearby asteroids. However, this breakthrough had now been replicated by multiple other colonies, causing a surplus of resources and plummeting prices. The colony's once-booming mining industry was now struggling to stay afloat, and many of its inhabitants found themselves facing unemployment and financial instability. As the colony's leaders scrambled to find a solution, tensions began to rise among the population, and some began to question whether the colony would even survive.
