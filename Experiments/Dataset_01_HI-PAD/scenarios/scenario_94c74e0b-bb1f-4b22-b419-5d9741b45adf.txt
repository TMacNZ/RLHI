In the vast expanse of the intergalactic universe, a group of intellectuals from various planets had gathered in North Africa to discuss the future of their civilizations. Among them was an African-American scholar who had been vocal about the need for greater representation of marginalized communities in the discussions. The disagreement began when one of the scholars from a dominant planet dismissed the African-American's views as irrelevant, citing the scholar's race as a basis for their argument. The room fell silent as tension rose, with some supporting the African-American and others defending the dominant planet's scholar. The argument escalated, and despite attempts to diffuse the situation, it became irreversibly heated, leading to a rift among the intellectuals that would have far-reaching consequences for intergalactic relations.
