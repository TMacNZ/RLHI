In the year 2087, humanity had finally achieved interstellar travel capabilities. However, a grave social challenge arose when a political conflict between the Pacific nations escalated to irreversibly disastrous levels. It all started when a group of scientists from the Pacific discovered an exact location in a far-off galaxy that could potentially sustain human life. The Pacific nations immediately claimed ownership of the discovery, causing tension and conflict with other nations. Despite efforts to negotiate and come to a peaceful resolution, the political tension continued to escalate. In an attempt to gain control of the discovery, the Pacific nations launched a military attack on their neighboring nations. The attack caused massive destruction and loss of life, leading to an irreversible divide between the Pacific nations and the rest of the world. This conflict forever changed the course of human history and the future of interstellar exploration.
