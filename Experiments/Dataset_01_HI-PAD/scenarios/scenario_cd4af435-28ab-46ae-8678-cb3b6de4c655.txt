In North Africa, a wave of political unrest has been sparked by environmental concerns. The government's lack of action on issues such as air pollution and water scarcity has led to widespread frustration among citizens. Protests have erupted across the country, with activists demanding that the government take immediate action to address these pressing environmental issues. The situation has been deemed ordinary in severity, but it has the potential to escalate if the government fails to respond to the demands of the people. The national or federal government is tasked with finding a solution that balances environmental protection with political stability, as the unrest could have broader implications for the region.
