Instead of fostering meaningful connections and meaningful relationships, online platforms have become a breeding ground for emotional challenges in Subsaharan Africa. While the internet has undoubtedly brought people closer together, it has also led to the rise of a culture of disingenuousness and superficiality, where individuals are more concerned with projecting an idealized version of themselves than with cultivating genuine human connections. This has resulted in a significant emotional toll, as individuals struggle to grapple with feelings of isolation and disconnection, despite being more "connected" than ever before. The pervasive nature of this social challenge is disruptive, and it highlights the need for a shift in the way we engage with one another online, prioritizing authenticity and vulnerability over the pursuit of likes and followers.
