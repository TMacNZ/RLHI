In a remote village in Subsaharan Africa, a group of students were gathered around their teacher, eagerly listening to a lesson on the cosmos. Suddenly, a loud rumble shook the ground beneath their feet. The teacher paused, looking up at the sky with a mixture of awe and fear. Above them, a massive cosmic storm was raging, its powerful winds threatening to tear apart the very fabric of the universe. As the storm intensified, the teacher knew that they needed to take action to protect their village from the dangerous cosmic forces. Quickly, they instructed the students to seek shelter in the nearby caves, where they could wait out the storm in safety. With a sense of urgency, the teacher led the way, hoping that they would all make it through the night unscathed.
