In the middle of the night, the leaders of the world were summoned to an emergency meeting at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva. The reason for the crisis was a cosmic event - a black hole was approaching Earth, and the only way to save humanity was to build a bridge to a parallel universe. 

The scientists had calculated that the bridge could only be built in Europe, as it was the only region with the necessary resources and technology. However, the cost of building the bridge would be astronomical, and it would require the cooperation of all the countries in the region. 

As the leaders gathered in the conference room, they were presented with the plan for building the bridge. The ethical dilemma quickly became apparent - who would pay for it? 

The politicians argued back and forth, each one trying to protect their own interests. The smaller countries in Europe argued that they couldn't bear the cost alone, while the larger countries said that they shouldn't have to pay more than their fair share. 

Meanwhile, the clock was ticking. The black hole was getting closer, and the fate of humanity hung in the balance. 

Finally, the leaders came to a decision. They would pool their resources and build the bridge together, but they would also agree to a set of strict ethical guidelines for the use of the parallel universe. 

The bridge was built in record time, and humanity was saved. But the ethical dilemma lingered. Who would have access to the parallel universe? Who would control it? And what would happen if someone abused the power it offered? 

The leaders of the world knew they had made a grave decision, but they hoped that the guidelines they had put in place would be enough to prevent disaster. Only time would tell if they had made the right choice.
