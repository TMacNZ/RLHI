The city of Tunis was in a state of political unrest, and the intellectual community was in danger. A new government program had been implemented that aimed to suppress dissent and silence voices of opposition. This program had severe consequences for those who spoke out against the regime, including imprisonment, torture, and even death. The intellectuals of the city, who had long been critical of the government's policies, found themselves at the center of this crackdown. Many were forced to go into hiding, while others were arrested without charge. The situation had become life-threatening, and the future of intellectual discourse in the city was uncertain. The once-vibrant cultural scene had been replaced by fear and uncertainty, and it was unclear when or if things would ever return to normal.
