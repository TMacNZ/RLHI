In Subsaharan Africa, a technological failure in the distribution of medicine has caused long-lasting economic consequences. The system that was put in place to transport medicine throughout the region has been plagued with issues for months. The failure of this system has meant that many hospitals and clinics are running low on essential medicines, and in some cases, completely out. This has led to a rise in the number of people seeking medical attention, as well as an increase in the number of deaths from preventable diseases. The economic impact of this failure is also severe. The cost of medicine has skyrocketed due to the shortages, and many families are struggling to afford the care they need. The government is working to address the issue, but the damage has already been done. It will take time to rebuild the distribution system and restore access to affordable medicine for those who need it most.
