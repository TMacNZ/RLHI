In a distant galaxy far away from Earth, the intergalactic council was about to elect their new leader. However, just as the final round of voting was about to begin, a catastrophic natural disaster struck the planet of South Asia, which was one of the major contributors to the council. The disaster caused destruction on an unprecedented scale, wiping out entire cities and leaving millions of intergalactic citizens homeless and displaced. As a result, the political domain was thrown into chaos, with each council member vying for control and trying to secure their own interests. The electing process was put on hold indefinitely, as the council members scrambled to find a way to deal with the aftermath of the disaster and restore order to the region. It was a time of great uncertainty and fear as the fate of the intergalactic council hung in the balance.
