In the year 2087, as humanity continued to expand into the cosmos, a division emerged between those who saw the universe as an endless resource to be exploited and those who recognized the need for responsible stewardship of the planets and stars around us. This disagreement came to a head on the newly-discovered planet of Keth, located in a distant corner of the galaxy. One faction, led by the charismatic industrialist Zara Khan, sought to strip the planet of its valuable resources, ignoring the damage this would cause to the local ecosystem. The other faction, a loose coalition of scientists and activists based in Subsaharan Africa, argued that Keth was a unique and fragile world that needed to be studied and protected. Despite their ordinary severity, tensions between the two groups continued to escalate, with both sides accusing the other of being intellectually dishonest and self-serving. As the fate of Keth hung in the balance, the entire interstellar community watched and waited to see which side would prevail.
