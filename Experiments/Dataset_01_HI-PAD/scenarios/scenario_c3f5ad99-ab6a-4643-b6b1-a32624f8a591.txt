A recent health concern has been causing disruption in North America, particularly in spiritual or religious communities. It revolves around the sense of belonging to a community, which is crucial for many individuals' mental and emotional well-being. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many religious gatherings have been suspended or moved online, leaving members feeling disconnected and lost. The lack of physical connection and communal worship has led to feelings of isolation and loneliness among many members, which can lead to a decline in mental health. The issue has become global as many countries have implemented similar COVID-19 restrictions. Addressing this issue requires creative solutions to help individuals feel connected and supported, such as online support groups, social media engagement, and outdoor gatherings with proper safety measures in place. It is essential to find ways to navigate the pandemic while still maintaining the vital sense of belonging that spiritual and religious communities provide.
