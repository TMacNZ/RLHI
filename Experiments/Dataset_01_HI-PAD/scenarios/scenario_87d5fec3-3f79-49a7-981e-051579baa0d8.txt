In South America, two professors at a regional university engaged in a heated argument that could have had life-threatening consequences. The subject of their disagreement was the role of luck in a student's academic success. One of the professors argued that luck played a significant role in determining a student's academic achievement, while the other professor vehemently disagreed, stating that hard work and dedication were the only factors that mattered. As the argument escalated, the professors began shouting at each other, their faces turning red with anger. Students in the nearby classrooms could hear the commotion and feared for their safety. Finally, the university security was called to intervene and separate the two professors. It was a stark reminder of the importance of maintaining a civil and respectful discourse, even in educational settings where disagreements can arise.
