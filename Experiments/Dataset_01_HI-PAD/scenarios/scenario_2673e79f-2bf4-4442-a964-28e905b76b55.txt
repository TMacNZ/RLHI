In a remote location in Subsaharan Africa, a team of scientists worked tirelessly on their latest invention - a mainframe computer capable of deciphering the mysteries of the universe. After years of diligent work, the day of the grand unveiling finally arrived. The scientists gathered around the mainframe, eagerly awaiting the results of their creation. But as they powered on the computer, something went terribly wrong. A surge of electricity overloaded the mainframe, causing irreversible damage to the system. Suddenly, the mainframe started emitting a strange pulsing energy that spread across the region. Within days, reports flooded in of unexplained phenomena - crops withering, animals dying, and strange electromagnetic disturbances. It soon became clear that the mainframe's malfunction had caused catastrophic consequences on a cosmic scale. The scientists were devastated, realizing that their technological breakthrough had inadvertently triggered a disaster of epic proportions.
