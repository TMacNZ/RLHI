Tensions had been brewing for months between the two dominant factions of the Intergalactic Council, the Alliance and the Confederacy. But when a key member of the Confederacy was assassinated while on a diplomatic mission in the South Pacific, the situation took a serious turn. Both sides blamed each other for the attack, and the region quickly descended into political unrest. Social media platforms were flooded with propaganda and accusations, and protests erupted in major cities across the South Pacific. The situation was made even more complicated by the fact that the region was home to several important spaceports and trade routes, causing disruptions to intergalactic commerce. As the conflict between the Alliance and the Confederacy escalated, many feared that it could lead to a full-scale intergalactic war.
