The people were left to fend for themselves as the disaster had a continental scope, affecting millions of lives. Despite the heroic efforts of rescue teams and volunteers, the damage was irreversible, and the people of South Asia would never be the same again. The loss of knowledge and history would be felt for generations to come.
