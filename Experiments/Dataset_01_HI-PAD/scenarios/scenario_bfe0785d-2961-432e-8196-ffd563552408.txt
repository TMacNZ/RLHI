Lena and her chosen family were planning their annual trip to Europe. Each year, they would take turns picking the destination and planning the itinerary. This year, it was Lena's turn and she had her heart set on visiting a small town in Italy. However, her cousin Mark had recently invested in a new virtual reality headset and suggested they spend their vacation testing it out instead. Lena was disappointed and frustrated that Mark seemed more interested in technology than spending quality time together as a family. A heated argument ensued, with Lena insisting they stick to their original plan and Mark insisting they try something new and exciting. The wish to have a peaceful and enjoyable vacation together seemed to be slipping away as the disagreement escalated.
