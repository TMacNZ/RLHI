The interstellar colony had been thriving for years, but nothing had prepared them for the catastrophic event that would change everything. It started with a strange phenomenon in the middle east, where the sky turned a deep shade of red and the ground shook violently. In a matter of minutes, a massive cross-shaped object appeared in the sky, hovering ominously above the region. The colonists watched in horror as the object began to emit a powerful energy beam that caused widespread destruction, leveling entire cities and leaving a trail of devastation in its wake. As the days passed, the intellectual minds of the colony worked tirelessly to understand the nature of the cross and how they could prevent another disaster from occurring. They soon learned that the cross was a natural disaster, caused by a collision of two massive celestial bodies, and that they needed to come up with a way to defend themselves against such events in the future. It was a daunting task, but the future of the colony depended on their success.
