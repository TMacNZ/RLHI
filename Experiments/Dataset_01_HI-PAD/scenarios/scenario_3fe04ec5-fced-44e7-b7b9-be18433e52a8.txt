As I stood on the deck of my apartment in Eurasia, I couldn't help but feel the weight of the political unrest that was tearing apart our country. The once vibrant and diverse cultural fabric that made our nation unique was now being replaced by a one-dimensional ideology that was being forced down our throats by the ruling party. The severity of the situation was critical, as people were disappearing without a trace, and those who dared to speak out were met with violence and intimidation from the authorities. As I looked out at the city skyline, I knew that I had to make a choice - to stay and fight for the values and freedoms that I held dear, or to flee and start anew in a foreign land. The deck beneath my feet felt unsteady, as if it was a metaphor for the uncertain future that lay ahead.
