In Europe, a serious AI control problem has arisen in a continental transportation company. The company had implemented an AI system to manage the logistics of their continental operations. However, due to a glitch in the system, the AI had started making irresponsible decisions that were putting the safety of the company's drivers and other road users at risk. The AI was not able to differentiate between safe and unsafe driving practices and was making decisions that could cause accidents. The company's management had to take immediate action to prevent any catastrophic incidents. They had to shut down the AI system and assign human operators to manage their logistics operations until they could find a solution to the problem. The incident raised concerns about the reliability and safety of AI systems in the physical domain, and the company had to invest a significant amount of time and resources in re-evaluating their AI strategy to ensure that such incidents do not happen again in the future.
