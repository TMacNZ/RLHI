As part of a collaborative research effort, a team of entomologists from two South American universities were debating the best method for studying the behavior of an elusive fly species. The team had been working together for months and tensions were beginning to rise as different opinions emerged. One group believed that the best approach was to set up traps and observe the flies in their natural habitat, while the other group argued that capturing the flies and studying them in a lab setting would yield more accurate and comprehensive results. The disagreement had been simmering for weeks, causing delays in the project and putting a strain on the working relationship between the two universities. Despite attempts at compromise, both sides were unwilling to budge, and it seemed as though the argument would have long-lasting effects on the team's ability to work together effectively.
