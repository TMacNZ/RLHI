In Asia, there is a growing concern regarding the use of technology and its effects on interpersonal relationships. Many individuals have become so reliant on social media and other forms of technology that they struggle to satisfy their basic human need for connection and intimacy. This has resulted in a range of health concerns related to mental and emotional wellbeing. While technology has made it easier to connect with others, it can also create a sense of isolation and disconnection in individuals who rely on it too heavily. As a result, there has been a push to promote more balanced and healthy use of technology in interpersonal relationships. This includes encouraging individuals to prioritize face-to-face interactions and developing tools and resources to help individuals manage their technology use in a way that supports their overall wellbeing. The goal is to ensure that technology is used in a way that enriches, rather than detracts from, our ability to connect with others and satisfy our need for meaningful relationships.
