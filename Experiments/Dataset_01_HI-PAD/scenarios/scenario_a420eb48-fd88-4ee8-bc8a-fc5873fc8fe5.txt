As a professional in Europe, I've always been intrigued by how much luck can play into one's career path. Some people seem to have all the good fortune, landing one opportunity after another without much effort. Others, like myself, struggle to catch a break despite our best efforts. It's a social challenge that most of us face at some point in our lives, and it can be frustrating to watch others succeed while we feel stuck in place. In my case, I've turned to my spiritual beliefs to help me cope with the ups and downs of my professional journey. I believe that everything happens for a reason, and that my struggles are simply a test of my strength and resilience. By staying grounded in my faith, I'm able to keep pushing forward and trusting that my luck will eventually turn around.
