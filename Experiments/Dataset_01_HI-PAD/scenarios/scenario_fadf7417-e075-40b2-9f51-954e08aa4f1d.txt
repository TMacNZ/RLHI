Finally, after years of international debate, a decision was made regarding the ethical dilemma surrounding physical punishment in the Middle East. The severity of the issue had been recognized globally, as it raised concerns about the treatment of individuals in this region. After much discussion, it was decided that physical punishment would be prohibited in all Middle Eastern countries. This was a significant change, as physical punishment had been a longstanding tradition in many cultures in the region. However, the decision was made in recognition of the fact that such punishment was often excessive and inhumane. The ban on physical punishment was welcomed by many human rights organizations, who had been advocating for this change for years. While some individuals and traditionalists in the region were initially resistant to the decision, over time, they began to see the benefits of this change. Overall, the decision to ban physical punishment in the Middle East was a positive step forward for human rights in the region.
