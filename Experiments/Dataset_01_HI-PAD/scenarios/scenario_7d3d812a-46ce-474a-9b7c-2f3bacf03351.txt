The choice was a difficult one for the extended family as they huddled together in their small home in the midst of political unrest in Asia. With the streets outside filled with protesters and police, they knew that every decision they made could be life-threatening. Emotions ran high as they debated whether to stay put and hope for the best or to flee to a safer location. Each member of the family had their own opinion and fears, adding to the already tense situation. The grandparents, who had lived through previous uprisings, were urging the family to leave immediately, while the younger generation felt torn between loyalty to their homeland and the need to protect themselves. As they weighed their options, the sound of gunfire and shouting grew louder, and the family knew that they had to make a choice quickly. With heavy hearts, they packed what they could carry and fled into the night, hoping that they had made the right decision. The emotional toll of leaving their home and everything they knew behind would stay with them for a long time to come.
