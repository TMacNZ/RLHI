In the year 2200, the Intergalactic Federation was facing an unexpected financial crisis. The crisis had spread to all the sectors, including the domestic sector. The Eurasian region was the hardest hit, with many families struggling to make ends meet. The crisis had also affected the physical domain, with many people unable to access basic necessities such as food and water. Despite the severity of the financial crisis, it was considered insignificant in the grand scheme of things. The Intergalactic Federation had faced much worse crises in the past, and they were confident that they would overcome this one. The Federation immediately implemented measures to address the crisis, including providing financial assistance to affected families and increasing the production of basic necessities. As a result, the crisis was contained within a few months, and the Federation was able to return to its normal operations.
