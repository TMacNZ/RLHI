We were sitting in a crowded caf√© in the heart of Tokyo, enjoying our lattes and chatting about our travels. Suddenly, my friend's face scrunched up in annoyance as she fiddled with her smartwatch. "Ugh, sorry guys," she muttered, "I keep getting notifications about my heart rate being too high." We all looked concerned as she showed us the readings on her watch, which had spiked significantly in the past few minutes. She explained that she had been experiencing some health concerns lately and had started using the watch to track her vitals. While the technology was helpful, it was also causing her undue stress and anxiety, as any fluctuations in her heart rate would trigger notifications and alarms. We all assured her that she looked fine and suggested she take a few deep breaths to calm down. As we continued our conversation, I couldn't help but wonder about the unintended consequences of relying too heavily on technology for our health concerns.
