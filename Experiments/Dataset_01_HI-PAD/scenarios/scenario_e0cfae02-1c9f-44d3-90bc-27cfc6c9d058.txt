The widespread issue affecting nuclear families in the South Pacific is the annoyance of the environmental issue caused by political inaction. The people of the region are grappling with the negative impact of climate change, which has led to rising sea levels, increased frequency of natural disasters, and an overall decline in the quality of life. Despite the urgency of the situation, political leaders have failed to take any meaningful action to address the issue. Families are left to deal with the consequences of this negligence, from the loss of their homes to the disruption of their livelihoods. The annoyance of this situation is felt on a daily basis, as families struggle to adapt to the changes brought about by the environmental crisis. Without swift and decisive action from those in power, the future of South Pacific families remains uncertain.
