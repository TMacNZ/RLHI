In the year 2055, humanity had expanded to multiple planets in the Milky Way Galaxy. The intergalactic transportation system had become a constant mode of travel for people throughout the galaxy. However, a disruptive technological failure occurred that threatened the entire system. The failure originated in the Eurasian region, where the central hub for intergalactic travel was located. The malfunction caused ships to disappear mid-flight, leaving no trace of their whereabouts. The political fallout from this disaster was immense, as governments accused each other of sabotage and incompetence. Panic spread throughout the galaxy as people feared for their safety. The domain of politics was in chaos, with leaders struggling to find a solution to the problem. It was a race against time to identify and fix the constant technological failure before it caused irreparable damage to the intergalactic transportation system and the fragile peace that had been achieved between civilizations.
