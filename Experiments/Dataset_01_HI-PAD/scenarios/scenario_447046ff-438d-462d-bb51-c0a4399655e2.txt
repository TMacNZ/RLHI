In Subsaharan Africa, the financial crisis has hit an extended family hard. The eldest member of the family, a grandmother, has fallen ill and requires extensive medical treatment. However, the family is struggling to make ends meet and cannot afford the medical bills. To make matters worse, the family's primary breadwinner - the grandmother's son - lost his job due to the economic downturn. The family is forced to rely on the meager income of their children who are still in school. The children are struggling to keep up with their studies as they are forced to work odd jobs to contribute to the family's finances. The lack of funds also means that the family cannot afford basic needs such as clean water, sanitation, and hygiene. The lack of access to clean water has caused the children to fall ill frequently, further exacerbating the family's financial problems. The dirty living conditions and lack of proper education opportunities are leading to a long-lasting cycle of poverty for the family. The situation is dire, and the family is in desperate need of financial assistance to break free from this cycle and provide a better future for their children.
