Approximately thirty members of an extended family living in a rural village in Subsaharan Africa are facing a critical situation due to escalating conflict and violence in the region. The family's physical safety is at risk as they fear being targeted by armed groups that have been attacking and looting nearby communities. The family's home and farmland have already been destroyed, leaving them with limited resources and no means to support themselves. They are now living in a makeshift shelter and relying on the generosity of neighboring families for food and water. The tension and fear are palpable, and the family members are constantly on edge, never knowing when the next attack will occur. They are desperately seeking a way to escape the violence and find a safe haven for themselves and their children.
