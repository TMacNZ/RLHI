The rain had been pouring down for days, causing widespread flooding and landslides across the South Pacific region. The disruption was felt in every country, with people losing their homes, their livelihoods, and even their lives. As aid agencies rushed to provide relief, an ethical dilemma emerged. Reports began to circulate that some aid workers were taking advantage of the situation, demanding sexual favors in exchange for assistance. The news shocked the international community, and a heated debate ensued about how to address the issue. Some argued that the perpetrators should be punished severely, while others suggested that the root causes of such behavior needed to be examined. As the rain continued to fall, the ethical dilemma deepened, and the need for a swift and just resolution became ever more pressing.
