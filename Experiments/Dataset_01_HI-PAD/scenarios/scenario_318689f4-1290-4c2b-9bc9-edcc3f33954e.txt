In the Eurasian region, golf was more than just a sport; it was a symbol of luxury and privilege. The elite played on exclusive courses, while the common citizens could only dream of stepping foot on the manicured greens.

However, this all changed when political unrest swept the country. The government, facing pressure from the masses, began to crack down on the wealthy and their extravagant lifestyles. One of their targets was golf.

The government passed a series of laws that made it nearly impossible for golf courses to operate. They claimed that the land could be put to better use for agriculture or housing for the working class. Many golf course owners tried to fight the laws in court, but they were no match for the government's legal team.

Soon, the once-green courses were replaced with drab apartment buildings and farms. The wealthy were forced to find new hobbies, and the game of golf became a distant memory.

The irreversible damage had been done, and the country would never be the same. The government's actions had created a divide between the rich and poor that would take years to heal. And for those who loved golf, they could only look back on the past and wonder what could have been.
