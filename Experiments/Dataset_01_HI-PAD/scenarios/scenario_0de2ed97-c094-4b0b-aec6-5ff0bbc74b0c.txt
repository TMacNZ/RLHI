In North Africa, the extended family of Hassan is facing an ethical dilemma due to a motion that they are considering. Hassan's uncle, who is the head of the household, proposed a plan to cut down a vast number of trees in the nearby forest to expand their farming land. While the family is struggling to make ends meet, they cannot ignore the impact this action will have on the environment. This motion has caused annoyance amongst the family members, as they have conflicting opinions on the matter. Hassan believes that it is their responsibility to protect the environment and that they should find an alternative solution to their financial problems. Meanwhile, his cousin, who stands to benefit from the land expansion, argues that they have no other option. The family is torn between their financial needs and their moral obligations towards the environment, and they must find a way to resolve this ethical dilemma before it's too late.
