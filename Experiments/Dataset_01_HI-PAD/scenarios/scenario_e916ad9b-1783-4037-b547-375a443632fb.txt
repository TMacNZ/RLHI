In Subsaharan Africa, political unrest has led to a long-lasting struggle for stability. The international community has been hesitant to intervene, leaving many local citizens feeling like unwelcome guests in their own country. The technological domain has played a significant role in amplifying this issue, as social media platforms and messaging apps have been utilized by both the government and opposition to spread propaganda and incite violence. The region is in dire need of a solution that can mitigate the impact of technology on the political situation while also addressing the root causes of the unrest. Without a comprehensive approach, the situation will continue to escalate, leaving the people of Subsaharan Africa feeling like unwanted guests in their own homes.
