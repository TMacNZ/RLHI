Anna and her best friend, Maria, had always been strong and inseparable. But one day, they got into a huge argument that turned catastrophic. It all started when Anna decided to move to a different country in Eurasia to pursue her dream job. Maria, on the other hand, wanted Anna to stay and be there for her as she was going through some tough times. This disagreement led to a heated argument that eventually ended their friendship. They both said things they didn't mean and their emotions got the best of them. Now, they both regret the things they said and miss each other terribly, but their pride is keeping them from reaching out and making amends.
