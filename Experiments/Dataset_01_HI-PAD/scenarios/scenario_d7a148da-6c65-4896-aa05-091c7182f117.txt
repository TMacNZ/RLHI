In the South Pacific, a typical technological failure has caused a legal dispute between two parties in an interpersonal relationship. The so-called "smart contract" that was meant to automate the transfer of funds between them has malfunctioned, resulting in a significant amount of money being lost. The two parties, who were once close friends, are now embroiled in a bitter legal battle over who is responsible for the failure and who should bear the financial loss. The situation has caused a rift between them, and their once-strong relationship is now strained. As the case moves through the legal system, it remains to be seen whether they will be able to repair their friendship or whether the damage caused by the technological failure will be irreparable.
