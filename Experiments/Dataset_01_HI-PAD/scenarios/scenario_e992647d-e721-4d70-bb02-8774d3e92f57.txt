In North Africa, cancer has become a social challenge that has affected the entire region. With the rise of online communication and accessibility, there is a need for educational resources to help people understand the disease and its impact. Many people in the region have limited access to healthcare, and as a result, cancer cases are often not detected until they have reached an advanced stage. Educational resources that are accessible online can help to raise awareness about prevention, early detection, and treatment options. By providing this information, people can take proactive measures to protect themselves and their loved ones from the devastating effects of cancer.
