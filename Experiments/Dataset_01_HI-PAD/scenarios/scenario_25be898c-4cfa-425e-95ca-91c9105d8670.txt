Amid a family gathering in Europe, tension began to rise between two cousins over the ownership of a rare book. The book, a valuable first edition, had been in the family for generations, but now both cousins claimed it was rightfully theirs. The argument escalated quickly, with accusations of theft and deceit being thrown back and forth. Other family members tried to intervene and calm the situation, but the two cousins were too focused on proving their point. The situation became so heated that it eventually turned physical, with the cousins throwing punches and causing a scene. The family had to step in to separate them and diffuse the situation. Despite attempts to reconcile, the tension between the cousins continued to linger throughout the rest of the family gathering. The incident left everyone feeling uneasy, and the family was forced to come to terms with the fact that their intellectual belongings could cause just as much conflict as their physical possessions.
