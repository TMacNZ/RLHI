In a small village in Subsaharan Africa, the residents woke up to a catastrophic technological failure. The power grid had failed, and with it, all the electronic devices in the town. The people were left in complete darkness, without any means of communication or transportation. They had no idea what had happened, but they knew they had to do something. The village elders went to the city to get help, but they found that the whole region was affected. The failure had spread across the entire country, and there was no way to fix it. The people were forced to go back to their traditional ways of living, relying on the natural resources of the land. They realized that they had been too dependent on technology, and it had failed them when they needed it the most. The experience made them rethink their relationship with technology and the importance of being self-sufficient. They learned that they could not always rely on something that was not within their control and that they needed to be prepared for any eventuality.
