In some parts of North Africa, there are legal restrictions on who can use public swimming pools. This social challenge has created a life-threatening situation for individuals who are denied access to pools due to their ethnicity, religion, or social status. Many people in these communities are unable to afford private pools and rely on public facilities for recreational and exercise purposes. The legal restrictions have also led to tensions between different groups and have hindered social integration. In some cases, people have attempted to access pools illegally, which has resulted in physical altercations and even fatalities. The lack of access to public pools has also had a negative impact on public health, as swimming is an important form of exercise and recreation. To address this issue, there is a need for legal reforms that promote equality and social integration, as well as increased investment in public health and recreation infrastructure.
