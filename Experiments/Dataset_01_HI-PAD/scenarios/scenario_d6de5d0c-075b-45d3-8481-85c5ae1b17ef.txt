A large consulting firm's client, a pharmaceutical company, has discovered a dangerous health concern in one of their intellectual properties that was distributed across the South Pacific region. The medication was supposed to be a revolutionary cure for a rare disease, but it has been discovered that the drug has severe side effects that could potentially be life-threatening. The client is now facing legal and financial repercussions, as well as the ethical dilemma of how to handle the situation. The consulting firm must work quickly to come up with a strategy to mitigate the damage and find a solution that will not only protect the client's reputation but also the safety of the patients who have taken the medication.
