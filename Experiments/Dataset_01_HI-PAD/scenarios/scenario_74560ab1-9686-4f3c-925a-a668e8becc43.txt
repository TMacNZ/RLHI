Lena had always been a bit of an outsider in her family. She never quite fit in with her parents or her sister, but she found her chosen family in her group of friends. They had all met while backpacking in the South Pacific, and they had stuck together ever since. 

One day, Lena received a frantic phone call from her friend Sarah. "Lena, have you heard about the financial crisis? It's hitting us hard. We might have to cut our trip short."

Lena was stunned. She had been so caught up in the beauty of the South Pacific that she hadn't even considered the possibility of a financial crisis. She immediately called a group meeting, and they all sat down to discuss their options.

"We could try to get jobs here," suggested Jake. "But I don't know if we would make enough to sustain ourselves."

"We could cut back on expenses," said Sarah. "But we're already living pretty frugally."

Lena listened to their suggestions, but she couldn't shake the feeling that they needed to do something more drastic. That's when she got an idea.

"What if we all got matching tattoos?" she suggested. "Something that would signify our chosen family and remind us that we're in this together."

The group was hesitant at first, but Lena's enthusiasm soon won them over. They found a local tattoo artist and each got a small impression of a palm tree on their wrist.

As they left the tattoo parlor, Lena felt a sense of belonging that she had never experienced before. She knew that no matter what challenges they faced, they would always have each other. And in that moment, the financial crisis seemed insignificant compared to the strength of their chosen family.
