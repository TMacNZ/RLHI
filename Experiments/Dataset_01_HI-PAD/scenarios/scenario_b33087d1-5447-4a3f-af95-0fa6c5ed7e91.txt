In the year 2150, a group of South Asian students were enrolled in an interstellar educational program that aimed to teach them about the universe and its mysteries. Among the students were two passionate individuals who held totally different views about the origins of the universe. One believed in the Big Bang theory while the other claimed that the universe was created by a higher power. As they delved deeper into their studies, their disagreement intensified into a heated argument. The typical severity of their disagreement threatened to disrupt the harmony of the entire educational program. The instructors had to intervene and find a way to resolve the conflict before it escalated any further.
