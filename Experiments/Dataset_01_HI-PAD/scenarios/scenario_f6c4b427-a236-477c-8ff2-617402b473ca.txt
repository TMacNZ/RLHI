The situation in South America had reached a critical level of severity. The political unrest had escalated to a point where the government was no longer able to contain the growing civil unrest. This was made even worse by the fact that the environmental domain was also affected by the turmoil. The people were protesting against the government's apathy towards the rampant deforestation and the destruction of natural habitats. The situation had now spiraled out of control, and the cosmic balance of nature was at stake. It was clear that urgent action was needed to contain the situation before it spread beyond the borders of South America and caused irreparable harm to the planet.
