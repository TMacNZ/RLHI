In the South Pacific, the concept of chosen family was taken very seriously. It was a common practice for people to form close bonds with others who were not necessarily blood relatives, but who they considered family nonetheless. However, a critical social challenge arose when it came to legal matters. In a particular case, a member of a chosen family was in dire need of a lung transplant to breathe properly. Unfortunately, the laws in the region did not recognize chosen family as a legitimate relationship and therefore, the person was not eligible to receive a transplant from a family member. This sparked a legal battle that brought attention to the issue and resulted in a change in the law to recognize the importance of chosen family in the region. Thanks to this change, the person was able to receive the transplant they needed and continue breathing with the support of their chosen family.
