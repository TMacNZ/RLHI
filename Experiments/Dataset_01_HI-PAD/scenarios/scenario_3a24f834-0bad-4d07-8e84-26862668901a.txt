Criticism has become a disruptive force in North Africa, as people grapple with the ethical dilemma of how to hold their leaders accountable for their actions. In many countries in the region, citizens who dare to voice their dissent are met with censorship, imprisonment, or worse. This has led to a culture of fear, where constructive criticism has been suppressed, and corruption and abuse of power have gone unchecked. Those who do criticize their leaders often do so in hushed tones, behind closed doors, or on social media platforms where they can remain anonymous. Nevertheless, the desire for change persists, and many people are working tirelessly to create a more just and equitable society, where criticism is seen as a necessary tool for progress rather than a threat to stability.
