As political unrest continued to simmer in Subsaharan Africa, the lower branches of extended families were feeling the impact. Many scientific professionals were finding it difficult to continue their work amidst the chaos, with research projects being put on hold and laboratories being forced to close. This was especially true for those whose work was deemed politically sensitive, as they were perceived as potential threats by those in power. The situation was only exacerbated by the fact that many members of the extended family were struggling to make ends meet, as the economy faltered under the weight of the political turmoil. As a result, tensions were running high and many were beginning to fear for their safety. The lower branches of the family were caught in the middle of a larger struggle, powerless to affect the outcome.
