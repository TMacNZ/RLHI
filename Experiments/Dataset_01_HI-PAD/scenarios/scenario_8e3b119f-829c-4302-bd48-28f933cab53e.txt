In South Asia, negotiating the cost of healthcare can be catastrophic for patients and families. Due to cultural beliefs and financial constraints, seeking medical treatment can be a difficult decision. The cost of healthcare in the region can be exorbitant, and negotiating the price can lead to inadequate care or even refusal of treatment. In some cases, families may resort to selling their assets to pay for medical expenses, leaving them in dire financial circumstances. This cultural domain of healthcare poses a significant challenge to healthcare providers who must balance the need for quality care with the financial limitations of their patients. As a result, patients may avoid seeking medical treatment until their condition becomes critical, leading to more severe health concerns and even death. The negotiation of healthcare costs in South Asia highlights the need for a more equitable and affordable healthcare system that places the well-being of patients and families at the forefront.
