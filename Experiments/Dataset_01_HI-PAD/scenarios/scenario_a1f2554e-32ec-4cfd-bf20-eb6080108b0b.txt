Mr. Ahmed Al-Saud, a renowned environmental scientist, was alarmed at the severity of the environmental issue he had uncovered in the Middle East. His research had revealed that the region was facing a serious threat due to the exponential increase in carbon emissions. The use of fossil fuels in the region had skyrocketed in the last decade, leading to devastating consequences such as air pollution and climate change. Mr. Al-Saud knew that this issue needed to be addressed on an international level to prevent irreversible damage to the environment. He immediately contacted his colleagues in different countries to discuss the matter and came up with a plan to present their findings at the United Nations Climate Change Conference. It was a race against time, and Mr. Al-Saud and his team worked tirelessly to gather as much data as possible to support their cause. They knew that the fate of the planet was at stake, and they were determined to make a difference.
