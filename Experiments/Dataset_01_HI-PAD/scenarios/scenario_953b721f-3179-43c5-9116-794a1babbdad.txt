The main issue that has been causing dangerous repercussions in the European economic realm is the mundane problem of supply chain disruption. The pandemic has caused a ripple effect, leading to a shortage of raw materials and labor in various industries, ultimately affecting the overall productivity and stability of the economy. The situation is most severe in the manufacturing and logistics sectors, where delays in production and transportation have led to a significant decrease in revenue and profitability. To mitigate the impact, businesses are forced to find alternative sources of materials and labor, often paying a premium price, which in turn puts additional pressure on their financial resources. The economic fallout of this issue is expected to last for an extended period and could have long-term consequences for businesses and the economy as a whole.
