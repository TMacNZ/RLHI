In a small village in Asia, a catastrophic environmental issue has caused widespread devastation among the chosen family living there. The issue began with false information spread by a large corporation that had been dumping toxic waste into the local river. They claimed that their waste was harmless and that it would have no negative impact on the environment or the people living in the area. However, it soon became clear that this was far from the truth. The river began to turn a sickly green color, and soon after, the crops in the surrounding fields started to wither and die. The chosen family living in the village relied on these crops for their livelihood, and the sudden loss of their main source of income has left them struggling to survive. The toxic waste has also contaminated the local water source, making it unsafe to drink and causing a rise in illnesses and diseases among the villagers. The chosen family is now facing a dire situation, with no access to clean water or food, and no means to support themselves financially. They have been left to face the devastating consequences of the false information spread by the corporation, and they are now in desperate need of help to rebuild their community and their lives.
