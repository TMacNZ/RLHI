As a group of close-knit friends, my chosen family and I frequently debate various scientific topics over dinner. However, during our trip to South Asia, a minor annoyance threatened to escalate into a full-blown argument. The topic of debate was the role of the front brain in decision-making processes. One member of the group adamantly argued that the front brain was solely responsible for rational decision-making, while another member disagreed, claiming that emotions also played a significant role. The disagreement began to heat up as both sides passionately defended their positions. However, before things got out of hand, a compromise was reached: while the front brain is indeed essential for rational decision-making, emotions can also influence our choices. With this resolution, we were able to continue our scientific discussions without further disagreement.
