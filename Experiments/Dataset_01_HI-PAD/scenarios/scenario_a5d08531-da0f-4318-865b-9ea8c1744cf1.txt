In the South Pacific region, a critical social challenge has arisen due to the inadequacy of the educational curriculum. The outdated curriculum fails to meet the needs of the students, leaving them unprepared for the constantly evolving world. The lack of practical skills and knowledge has resulted in a significant gap between students and the job market. The problem has been recognized by educational policymakers, but the process of developing a new curriculum is slow and complicated. The longer it takes to implement the new curriculum, the more students will be left behind. The severity of the situation demands immediate action to ensure that the future generations are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in the ever-changing world.
