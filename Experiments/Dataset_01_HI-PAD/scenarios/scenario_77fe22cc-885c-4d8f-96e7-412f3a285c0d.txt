The regional government had learned a hard lesson about underestimating the power of social media. Disruptive protests had erupted across the Eurasian region, sparked by a controversial political decision that had been made in secret. The people felt betrayed, and they took to the streets to demand accountability. The government had tried to suppress the protests, but the images and videos shared on social media had gone viral, and the movement had grown beyond their control. It had become a state-wide crisis that threatened to destabilize the entire government. The lesson was clear: in the age of social media, governments had to be transparent and accountable, or they risked facing the wrath of their people.
