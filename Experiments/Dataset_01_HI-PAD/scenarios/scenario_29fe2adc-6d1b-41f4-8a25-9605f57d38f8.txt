Their philosophical disagreement has escalated to a dangerous level, causing concern not only within their academic community but also internationally. The two esteemed philosophers, who once engaged in lively debates and discussions, have now become bitter rivals. Their intellectual differences have spilled over into personal attacks, and they have both taken to social media to publicly criticize each other. The situation has become so severe that security measures have been put in place at their respective universities in North America.

As international scholars continue to monitor the situation with growing apprehension, the two philosophers seem to show no signs of backing down, leaving the future of their once-respected field uncertain.
