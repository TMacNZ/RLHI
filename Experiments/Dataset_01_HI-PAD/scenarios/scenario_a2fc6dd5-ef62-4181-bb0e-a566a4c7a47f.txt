The lack of proper waste management in Eurasia has caused a long-lasting social challenge that is taking a toll on the environment. Piles of garbage, including old books, litter the streets and pollute the air, causing health problems for the residents. The situation has become so dire that some neighborhoods have resorted to burning their trash, releasing harmful toxins into the atmosphere. The government has attempted to address the issue by implementing recycling programs, but the lack of education and infrastructure has made it difficult to achieve significant progress. As a result, the sight of discarded books and other waste has become a common feature in many streets of Eurasia, reminding the residents of the urgent need to take action to protect their environment.
