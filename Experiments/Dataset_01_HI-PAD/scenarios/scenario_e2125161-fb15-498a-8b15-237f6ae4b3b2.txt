In a small village in Subsaharan Africa, a group of children gathered around a computer that had been donated by an intergalactic organization. Despite the fact that the computer was outdated and slow, the children were fascinated by it. They took turns typing and exploring the different programs available. One young girl, in particular, was especially drawn to the computer. She spent hours on it every day, typing away at the keyboard. Her parents noticed a change in her behavior, as she became more withdrawn and less interested in playing with her friends. Concerned, they took her to a local health clinic, where they learned that the computer had become a source of emotional stress for her. The clinic provided counseling services to help the young girl cope with her feelings and recognize the importance of balancing her time between technology and social interactions. In the end, the situation was resolved, and the children continued to enjoy the computer in a healthy and balanced way.
