Tensions had been brewing for months in North America between two religious groups, but it wasn't until a prominent leader of one of the groups made a disparaging comment about the other's religious practices that things came to a head. Protests and counter-protests erupted in major cities, with both sides accusing the other of intolerance and discrimination. The situation escalated quickly, with reports of violence and property damage. As a professional in the region, it was impossible to ignore the impact of the political unrest on daily life. Businesses closed early, public transportation was disrupted, and many people were afraid to leave their homes. In the midst of it all, the word "skin" took on a new significance, as people were targeted not just for their beliefs, but also for their appearance. The severity of the situation was clear, and it was clear that a solution would require both sides to come to the table and work towards understanding and reconciliation.
