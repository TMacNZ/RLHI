As summer temperatures rise, the issue of staying cool becomes increasingly important for those living in North America. However, researchers have discovered that the desire to maintain a cool environment may have unintended health consequences. A new scientific study has found that excessive exposure to air conditioning can have negative impacts on cardiovascular health, particularly for those with pre-existing conditions. The study, conducted at a national level, suggests that while staying cool may be a priority, individuals must also be mindful of the potential health risks associated with excessive air conditioning. This research highlights the need for further exploration into the intersection of environmental factors and human health concerns.
