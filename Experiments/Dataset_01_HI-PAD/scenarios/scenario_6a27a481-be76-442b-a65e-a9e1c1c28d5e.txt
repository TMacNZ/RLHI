In a small village in Subsaharan Africa, a nuclear family faced a social challenge due to the environmental domain. The family had been living in the same house for generations, but lately, they noticed a strange smell emanating from the walls. As they investigated, they discovered that the tongue and groove paneling used in their home was made from a type of wood that was now rotting and releasing a foul odor. Though the severity of the situation was insignificant, it was still a cause for concern as the smell was becoming increasingly unpleasant. The family decided to take action by contacting a local carpenter who could help them replace the paneling with a more durable and sustainable material. Through this simple solution, the family was able to improve their living conditions and contribute to a healthier environment in their village.
