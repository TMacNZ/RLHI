The evolution of the universe is a complex and fascinating phenomenon that has been the subject of countless debates and arguments over the years. In the South Pacific, a group of economists have been engaged in a heated disagreement over the irreversible economic consequences of the universe's evolution. As the universe continues to expand and change, these economists fear that the economic systems of the world will not be able to keep up, leading to a catastrophic collapse of the global economy. Despite their best efforts to find solutions to this problem, the economists remain divided in their opinions, and it seems that the only thing that is certain is that the universe will continue to evolve, regardless of the economic consequences.
