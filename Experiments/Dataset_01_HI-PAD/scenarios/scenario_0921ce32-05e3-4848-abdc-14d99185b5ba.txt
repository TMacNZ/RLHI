The increasing use of technology has created a dangerous social challenge in North America. As more and more people rely on digital communication, the art of face-to-face conversation is slowly being lost. This miss in interpersonal skills is particularly concerning at the regional and statewide levels, where important discussions and negotiations may occur. Technological tools such as video conferencing and email have made communication more convenient, but they cannot replace the nuances of in-person interaction. The ability to read body language, interpret tone, and build trust through eye contact is essential for successful communication. Without these skills, misunderstandings can occur, and important decisions may be delayed or even derailed. It is crucial that individuals and organizations recognize the importance of developing and maintaining these interpersonal skills, even in the age of digital communication.
