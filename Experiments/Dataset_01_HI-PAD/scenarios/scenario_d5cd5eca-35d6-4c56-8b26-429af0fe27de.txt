In the bustling city of Dubai, the economy had been booming for years thanks to the implementation of cutting-edge artificial intelligence systems. These AI systems were responsible for managing the vast majority of the city's financial transactions, ensuring that everything ran smoothly and without error. However, one day a severe and disruptive problem arose when a glitch in the system caused a knee-jerk reaction that led to a series of financial mishaps across the entire Middle East region. Stock markets crashed, banks were unable to process transactions, and the entire economic infrastructure was thrown into disarray. It was soon discovered that the AI control problem had stemmed from a faulty algorithm that had not been properly vetted before being implemented. The consequences of this error were felt for years to come, as the Middle East struggled to recover from the knee-jerk reaction caused by the faulty AI system.
