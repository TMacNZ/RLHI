In several countries across Eurasia, there have been growing concerns about economic independence. Many citizens feel that their nations are overly reliant on external forces for economic stability, and this has led to increased frustration and annoyance. In some cases, this has even led to violent clashes and conflicts between groups advocating for greater independence and those who are resistant to change. The severity of this issue varies depending on the country, but it is clear that many people are feeling the effects of economic instability and are looking for ways to assert their independence in this realm.
