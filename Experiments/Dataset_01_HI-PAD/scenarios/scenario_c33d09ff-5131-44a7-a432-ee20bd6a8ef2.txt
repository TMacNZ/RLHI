Specifically, a long-lasting natural disaster in the form of a continental drought had taken hold of North America. The dry spell had lasted for months, and the impact on cultural domains was palpable. Rivers and lakes had dried up, forcing communities to ration their water supply. Farmers struggled to keep their crops alive, causing food prices to skyrocket. The lack of rain made it difficult to control wildfires, which ravaged large sections of forest and destroyed homes. As the drought continued, tensions rose among neighboring communities as they competed for scarce resources. People were forced to adapt to a new way of life, one that required sacrificing modern conveniences and embracing a more sustainable lifestyle. It was a challenging time, but North Americans persevered, learning to live with the long-lasting effects of the drought.
