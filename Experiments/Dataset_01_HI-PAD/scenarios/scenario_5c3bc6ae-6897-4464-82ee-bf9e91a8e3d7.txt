The sudden and unexpected arrival of a natural disaster can leave entire communities feeling like a cracked egg, fragile and vulnerable. When Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast, it was a disruptive force that left a trail of emotional devastation in its wake. Families were displaced from their homes and forced to rebuild their lives from scratch. The federal response was slow and inadequate, leaving many feeling abandoned and betrayed by their government. The emotional toll of the disaster was felt not just in the immediate region, but throughout the country, as people watched in horror and disbelief as the scope of the destruction became clear. The eggshell of their security had been shattered, and it would take years to rebuild and regain a sense of normalcy.
