There was plenty of excitement in the air as our extended family gathered for our annual reunion in Eurasia. As we hugged and caught up with one another, we couldn't help but notice the changes in the environment around us. The once lush green forests and vibrant blue lakes had now turned into barren lands and murky waters. We couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness wash over us as we realized the impact of environmental issues on our beloved homeland. The children, too, were affected by this change, as they couldn't run around and play in nature as they used to. It was a sobering reminder that we need to take responsibility for the environment and work towards preserving it for future generations. Despite the emotional weight of this realization, we found solace in being together as a family and vowed to do our part in protecting the environment.
