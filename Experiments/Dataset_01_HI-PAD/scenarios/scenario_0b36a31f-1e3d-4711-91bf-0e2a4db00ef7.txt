In many Pacific island cultures, a sense of belonging is critical to mental and physical health. However, for many individuals in the region, a lack of belonging due to political conflicts has had serious health consequences. The ongoing political tensions between several Pacific island nations have resulted in the displacement of many individuals from their homes and communities. As a result, many of these individuals have experienced a sense of isolation, loneliness, and a loss of cultural identity. This has contributed to high rates of mental illness, substance abuse, and other health concerns. Political leaders in the region must prioritize finding solutions to these conflicts and work towards creating a sense of belonging for all individuals affected by political unrest. Only then can the health and wellbeing of Pacific island communities be fully restored.
