In a small neighborhood in Subsaharan Africa, tensions have been rising due to a new technological tool - a uniform. The local police force has recently introduced new uniforms that are meant to identify them as official authorities, but instead, they have caused division and conflict amongst the community. Some residents feel that the uniforms are a symbol of oppression and have led to an increase in police brutality, while others feel that the uniforms are necessary for maintaining law and order. The situation has become so severe that protests and violent clashes have erupted in the streets, leaving the community divided and uncertain about the future.
