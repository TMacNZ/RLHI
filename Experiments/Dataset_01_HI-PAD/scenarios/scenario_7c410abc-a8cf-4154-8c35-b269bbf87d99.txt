As a recent graduate in South Asia, I couldn't help but feel annoyed by the political unrest surrounding environmental issues in the country. Despite the federal government's promises to address climate change and pollution, little progress seems to have been made. The air quality in major cities continues to worsen, with smog and haze becoming a daily occurrence. The lack of action on this issue makes me worry about the future of our planet and the wellbeing of the people living here. As a nation, we need to prioritize the environment and take concrete steps to mitigate the damage we are causing. It's time for our elected officials to step up and make a real difference before it's too late.
