The pride of two prominent religious leaders has caused an irreversible disagreement that is now causing a rift in the North American spiritual community. The debate began when both leaders claimed to have received a divine revelation regarding a certain religious practice. Despite attempts at mediation and discussion, both leaders refused to back down on their claims and instead continued to assert their own superiority. As a result, followers of each leader have taken sides and tensions are running high. Many are now worried that this dispute will cause irreparable harm to the spiritual community as a whole and may even lead to a schism.
