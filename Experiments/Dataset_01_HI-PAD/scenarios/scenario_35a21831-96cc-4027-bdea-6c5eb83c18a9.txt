In Subsaharan Africa, political unrest has led to a serious environmental crisis. The lack of distinction between political and environmental concerns has resulted in a situation where the natural resources are being depleted at an alarming rate. The government has failed to address the issue of deforestation, and as a result, the forests are being cleared for timber and agriculture. The loss of trees has led to soil erosion, which has further worsened the environmental degradation. The rivers and lakes are being polluted by industrial waste, and the air quality is deteriorating due to the burning of fossil fuels. The people are suffering from the effects of the environmental crisis, with many falling ill due to contaminated water and air. The need to distinguish between political and environmental concerns is crucial if the region is to recover from this crisis.
