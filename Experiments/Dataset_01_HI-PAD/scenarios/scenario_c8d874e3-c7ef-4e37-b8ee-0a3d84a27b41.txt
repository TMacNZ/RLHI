In Subsaharan Africa, there is a critical social challenge that is plaguing extended families. Many families have members who require medical operations, but they cannot afford the cost of the procedures. This problem is compounded by the fact that there are limited medical resources available in the region, making it difficult to find qualified doctors and hospitals that can perform the necessary surgeries. As a result, many families are forced to make tough decisions about how to allocate their limited resources. Some families may have to choose between paying for an operation or providing basic necessities like food and shelter. Others may have to make difficult choices about which family member to prioritize for treatment. This situation highlights the need for scientific advances that can make medical operations more accessible and affordable for families in Subsaharan Africa.
