As a young political science student in Europe, I was excited to attend a town hall meeting with a prominent senator from my country. I eagerly awaited the chance to hear her speak about the issues facing our nation and ask her questions about her policies. However, as soon as she took the stage, it became clear that she was not there to engage in a productive conversation. Instead, she launched into a tirade about her political opponents and their supposed corruption. Her words were divisive and disruptive, turning what should have been a forum for discussion into a platform for her own ego. I left the meeting feeling disillusioned and frustrated, realizing that even our most prominent political leaders can succumb to self-interest and personal gain.
