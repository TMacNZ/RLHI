In the aftermath of a devastating natural disaster in Subsaharan Africa, a group of educators were tasked with rebuilding a school that had been completely destroyed. They quickly realized that the students who had survived the disaster were in desperate need of therapy to cope with the trauma they had experienced.

The educators reached out to a team of therapists who specialized in working with children in crisis. Together, they developed a therapy program that focused on building chosen family relationships among the students.

The therapy sessions were held in a large tent that had been set up on the school grounds. The therapists used storytelling, art, and group activities to help the students bond with each other and form a sense of community.

One of the students, a young girl named Amina, had lost her entire family in the disaster. She was quiet and withdrawn, and had trouble connecting with the other students. But through the therapy sessions, she began to open up and share her feelings with the group.

As the weeks went on, the students became closer and more supportive of each other. They began to refer to themselves as a chosen family, and the educators noticed a marked improvement in their behavior and academic performance.

However, as the therapy program came to a close, the educators realized that the impact of the disaster was irreversible. Many of the students would never fully recover from the trauma they had experienced.

But they were determined to continue supporting the students and helping them build a sense of community. They knew that the chosen family relationships that had been formed during the therapy sessions would be crucial in helping the students cope with the ongoing challenges they would face in the years to come.
