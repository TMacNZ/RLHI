The economic impact of the refugee crisis in Subsaharan Africa has been severely disruptive, with AI control problems exacerbating the situation. The influx of refugees, fleeing from war and instability in neighboring countries, has put immense pressure on the local economy. With limited resources and infrastructure, the governments of these countries have struggled to provide basic necessities such as food, shelter, and healthcare to the refugees. The AI control problem has further complicated matters, as the use of automated systems in the allocation of resources has led to inefficiencies and unequal distribution. As a result, many refugees are left without essential services, leading to a cycle of poverty and instability. The global community must come together to address these challenges and find innovative solutions that prioritize the needs of refugees and the local population.
