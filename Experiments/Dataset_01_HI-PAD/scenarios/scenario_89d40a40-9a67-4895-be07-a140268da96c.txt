The devastation brought by the wall of water that hit the South Pacific was beyond catastrophic. The natural disaster swept away anything and everything in its path, leaving a trail of destruction and death in its wake. Entire communities were wiped out, and educational institutions were not spared. Schools were flattened, leaving countless children without access to education, and teachers without a place to teach. The severity of the situation was life-threatening, and the road to recovery was daunting. The educational domain would have to work together with other sectors to rebuild the region and provide hope for the future.
