As humanity began to expand into the cosmos, we encountered a biological anomaly that threatened to derail our interstellar ambitions. A strange virus, previously unknown to science, had struck several colonies in the Asia region, causing widespread panic and chaos. Despite the virus being classified as ordinary in severity, its rapid spread had created a financial crisis that threatened to bankrupt educational institutions across the affected regions. The virus was particularly devastating to those in the educational domain, with schools and universities forced to shut down to prevent the spread of the disease. With no cure in sight, the interstellar community was left scrambling to contain the outbreak and find a solution before it was too late.
