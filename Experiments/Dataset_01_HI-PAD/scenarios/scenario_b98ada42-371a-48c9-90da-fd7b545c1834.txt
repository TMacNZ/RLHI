The issue of grocery safety has become a dangerous problem in Europe, prompting national and federal officials to take action. With foodborne illnesses on the rise, it has become crucial for citizens to be educated on how to properly handle and store their groceries. Despite efforts to improve food safety regulations, lack of knowledge among consumers continues to be a social challenge. It is imperative that educational programs are implemented to teach individuals about proper food handling techniques and the importance of checking expiration dates. By providing the public with these tools, we can work towards decreasing the number of foodborne illnesses and ensuring a safer food supply for all.
