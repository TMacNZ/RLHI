In North Africa, there has been a long-lasting social challenge related to the spiritual or religious domain - the increasing use of online platforms to spread extremist ideologies that promote violence and even encourage people to die for their cause. This has led to a rise in radicalization, particularly among young people, who are often vulnerable and easily influenced by extremist groups. The online nature of these interactions makes it difficult for authorities to monitor and intervene, and the impact of this problem on communities and families can be devastating. Efforts are being made to counter this trend, including the use of social media campaigns to promote peace and tolerance, but it remains a significant challenge that requires ongoing attention and investment.
