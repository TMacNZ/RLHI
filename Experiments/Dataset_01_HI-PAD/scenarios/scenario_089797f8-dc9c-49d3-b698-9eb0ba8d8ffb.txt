The city of Mumbai was buzzing with excitement as the mayoral election drew near. The air was thick with the smell of street food and the sound of campaign slogans blaring out of loudspeakers. Politics had always been a hot topic in the bustling metropolis, but this time tensions were running particularly high. The two main candidates were neck and neck in the polls, and accusations of corruption and bribery were being thrown around on both sides. Meanwhile, the city's physical infrastructure was starting to suffer as a result of the campaign chaos - roads were clogged with campaign vehicles and posters were plastered all over buildings, obscuring important information. Despite the mundane nature of the issue, the citizens of Mumbai were feeling the effects of the political wrangling in a very real way.
