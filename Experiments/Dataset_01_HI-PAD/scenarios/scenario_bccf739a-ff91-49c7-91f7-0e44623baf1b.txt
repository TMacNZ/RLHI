The interstellar spaceship "Odyssey" has been traveling through the South Pacific for several months now, carrying a diverse crew from different parts of the world. Among them is a devout Asian crew member named Zhang, who has been practicing his religion in private throughout the journey. However, as the Odyssey approaches a nearby planet inhabited by an advanced alien civilization, the crew receives a transmission from the native inhabitants inviting them to a welcoming ceremony. The crew is excited to make contact with the aliens, but Zhang is hesitant. He has studied their culture and discovered that they have a strict prohibition against any form of religious expression, as it is believed to interfere with their scientific pursuits. Zhang is torn between his desire to honor his faith and his duty to respect the customs of the alien civilization. The crew is faced with a serious ethical dilemma: should they allow Zhang to practice his religion, potentially causing offense to the aliens, or should they forbid him from doing so, potentially compromising his religious freedom? As the Odyssey approaches the planet, the crew must confront this sensitive issue and determine the best course of action.
