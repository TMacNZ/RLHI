In a distant future where humanity has colonized outer space, a group of students from a North American educational institution are on a mission to study a cosmic phenomenon. They have been sent to a far-off planet to observe a rare event that occurs once every hundred years. However, their technological equipment malfunctions, and they are unable to record the event. Despite their best efforts, the students cannot fix the issue and must accept the failure of the mission. The situation is ordinary, but it is a reminder of the risks involved in space exploration and the importance of backup systems. The students return to Earth, disappointed but enriched by their experience.
