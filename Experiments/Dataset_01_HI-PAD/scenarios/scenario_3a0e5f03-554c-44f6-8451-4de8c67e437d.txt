In South America, the threat of a bomb detonation has become a typical social challenge that requires urgent attention from legal authorities at the regional or statewide level. The fear of an explosion in public spaces has paralyzed many communities and disrupted daily life. The legal system is struggling to cope with the enormity of the problem, as the perpetrators of these bombings often go unpunished. The situation has created a sense of distrust among citizens, who feel that the government is not doing enough to protect them. The legal domain is working to develop new strategies and technologies to detect and prevent these attacks, but progress has been slow. In the meantime, the people of South America are left to live in fear, wondering when and where the next bomb will go off.
