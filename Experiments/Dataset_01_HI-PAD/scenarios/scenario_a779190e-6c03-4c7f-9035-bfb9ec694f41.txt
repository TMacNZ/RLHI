As the pandemic raged on, schools and universities across South Asia shifted to online learning. While this allowed for some semblance of normalcy, it also brought its own set of challenges. One such challenge was the online examination.

For students, the online examination was a source of immense anxiety. The fear of the internet connection dropping, the possibility of technical glitches, and the inability to ask for help in person all made for a stressful experience. And for some, the stakes were even higher. Students who relied on good grades to secure their future, or those who were already struggling with mental health issues, found the online examination to be catastrophic.

As the day of the examination approached, social media was flooded with posts from students expressing their fears and frustrations. Many shared stories of their internet connection dropping midway through the test or their computer crashing, causing them to lose all their progress. Others talked about how difficult it was to concentrate at home, with family members and roommates constantly moving around and causing distractions.

The emotional toll of the online examination was not limited to just the students. Teachers too felt the weight of the situation. They had to deal with the added pressure of ensuring that the online examination was fair and unbiased, while also being empathetic to the students' struggles.

As the examination came to an end, there was a collective sigh of relief from students and teachers alike. But the emotional scars left behind by this experience would take a long time to heal. It was clear that while online learning had its benefits, there was still a long way to go before it could replace the traditional classroom experience.
