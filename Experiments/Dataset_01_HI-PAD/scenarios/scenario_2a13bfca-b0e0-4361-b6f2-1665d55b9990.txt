In a seemingly infinite universe, there are still limits to what we can control. In North America, a heated disagreement has erupted between environmentalists and developers over the construction of a new skyscraper. While the severity of this argument may seem insignificant compared to the grand scale of the cosmos, it highlights the limits of our ability to balance progress and preservation. The environmentalists argue that the construction of the skyscraper will harm the local ecosystem and destroy green spaces, while the developers argue that it is necessary for economic growth and job creation. Both sides are passionate and refuse to back down, but ultimately they must find a way to reach a compromise that respects the inherent limits of our environment.
