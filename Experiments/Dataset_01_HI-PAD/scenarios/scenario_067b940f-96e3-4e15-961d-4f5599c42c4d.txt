In the year 2150, interstellar travel became a reality. Humans could now explore the vast expanse of space and discover new worlds. As a result, many people left Earth to begin a new life on different planets. However, those who remained on Earth soon began to face catastrophic consequences. The North African region was hit by a severe environmental issue. The once lush green forests and vibrant wildlife were now replaced by barren deserts and scarce water resources. The cause of this disaster was the neglect of the people living in the region. They had ignored the signs of climate change and continued to harm the environment. As a result, the entire ecosystem was destroyed, and the people were left to suffer. This cultural catastrophe was a wake-up call for the rest of humanity to take responsibility for their actions and preserve the environment for future generations.
