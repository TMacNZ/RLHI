In North Africa, the lack of adequate financial enforcement has led to a catastrophic situation for professionals in the physical domain. The financial crisis has hit hard and many businesses are struggling to stay afloat. The lack of proper enforcement has made it easy for individuals and companies to default on their loans and debts. This has resulted in a domino effect, with banks and financial institutions also facing a severe financial crisis. The physical domain has been particularly affected, with businesses unable to invest in necessary equipment and infrastructure. As a result, there has been a significant decline in productivity and quality of work. The situation is dire and urgent measures need to be taken to enforce financial regulations and prevent further damage to the economy.
