The nuclear family of four had always lived in a modest home in a small village in Subsaharan Africa. The father, a civil engineer, had been the sole provider for the family for as long as he could remember. However, the recent financial crisis had hit the family hard, and they struggled to make ends meet. Despite the father's best efforts to secure new engineering contracts, there simply wasn't enough work to go around. As a result, the family had fallen behind on their bills and were facing legal action from creditors. They had already sold most of their possessions to make ends meet, and the children had stopped attending school due to the cost of tuition. Though the situation was dire, the family remained optimistic and hopeful that things would turn around.
