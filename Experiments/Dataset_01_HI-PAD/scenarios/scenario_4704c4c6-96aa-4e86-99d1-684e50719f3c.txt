The Nguyen family sat around the dinner table in their small home in Hanoi, Vietnam. Mrs. Nguyen, the matriarch of the family, had a stern look on her face as she began to speak. She had called this family meeting to discuss their agenda for the upcoming week. Her husband, Mr. Nguyen, sat attentively while their two children, a son and a daughter, fidgeted in their chairs. Mrs. Nguyen began by expressing her concern about the escalating conflict between the North and South in Vietnam. She reminded them of the philosophical principles that their family upheld, including non-violence and empathy for others. However, she also acknowledged that they needed to take measures to ensure their safety as a nuclear family. She proposed that they stock up on food and supplies and make a plan in case they needed to evacuate their home. Mr. Nguyen nodded in agreement, but their son protested, arguing that they should stand up and fight for their beliefs. Mrs. Nguyen calmly explained that there were many ways to fight for what they believed in, and that violence was not the answer. The family debated and discussed their options late into the night, but ultimately agreed to follow Mrs. Nguyen's plan and prioritize their safety while also staying true to their philosophical beliefs.
