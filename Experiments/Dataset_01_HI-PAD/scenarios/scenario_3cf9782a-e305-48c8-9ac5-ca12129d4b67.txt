Every week, the employees at a busy software development company in South Asia gather for a weekly meeting to discuss progress on ongoing projects. However, one week, as the employees were settling in for the meeting, they noticed that the large projector screen at the front of the room was not working. They attempted to troubleshoot the issue, but were unable to get the screen to display anything. As the meeting began without the visual aid, the team leader realized that this was not an isolated incident, and that the projector had been malfunctioning for some time. The severity of the issue became apparent as the team leader realized that key milestones and deadlines were missed because of the inability to effectively communicate progress on projects. The team leader immediately contacted the IT department to resolve the issue, and it was discovered that the projector had a physical malfunction that required a replacement part. The IT department was able to quickly procure the part and replace it, and the projector was fully functional for the next weekly meeting. However, the incident highlighted the importance of routine maintenance and monitoring of technological equipment to prevent disruptions to the team's productivity.
