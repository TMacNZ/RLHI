In a recent discussion with her chosen family in Europe, Fiona found herself in a philosophical disagreement. The group was debating the concept of free will and determinism, with some arguing that every choice we make is predetermined by external factors while others believed in the power of personal agency. Fiona fell into the latter camp, arguing that individuals have the power to make their own choices and shape their own destinies. The disagreement was civil, but passionate, with each member of the group presenting their own evidence and reasoning to support their position. Ultimately, they agreed to disagree, but the discussion left Fiona pondering the nature of choice and the role of fate in her own life.
