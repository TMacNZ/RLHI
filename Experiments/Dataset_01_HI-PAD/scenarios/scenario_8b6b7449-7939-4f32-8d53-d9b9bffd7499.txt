Ms. Karen, a middle-aged woman from the village, was having a disagreement with her neighbor, Ms. Maria, about the placement of a new fence. Maria had recently moved into the house next door and wanted to install a fence that would cut off a portion of Karen's backyard. Karen was emotional and disagreed with Maria's plan, as she had always enjoyed the open space and natural scenery. However, the severity of the disagreement was insignificant, and both women knew they would eventually come to a resolution. The disagreement between the two neighbors continued for a few days until they finally sat down and talked it out over a cup of tea. In the end, they found a compromise that worked for both of them, and the fence was erected in a way that didn't impede Karen's view.
