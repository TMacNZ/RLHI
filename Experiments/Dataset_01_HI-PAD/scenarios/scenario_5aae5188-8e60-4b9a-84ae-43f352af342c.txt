The Johnsons lived on a small island in the South Pacific, surrounded by crystal-clear waters and lush greenery. They were a happy nuclear family, consisting of Mark, his wife Sarah, and their two children, Emily and Jack. However, they had recently noticed that they weren't as sharp as they used to be. It seemed like they couldn't concentrate on anything anymore. 

Mark, who was a teacher, noticed that he was having difficulty remembering things he had taught for years. Sarah, who was a writer, was struggling to come up with new ideas for her next book. Even Emily and Jack, who were both excellent students, found it hard to focus on their school work. 

Concerned, they consulted the island's doctor, who advised them to take a closer look at their diet. He explained that the island's soil lacked iodine, a nutrient that is essential for brain development and function. The Johnsons had been living on the island for years and had adapted to the iodine-deficient environment without even realizing it. 

The doctor prescribed them iodine supplements and suggested that they include more seafood in their diet, which is a good source of iodine. The Johnsons followed the doctor's advice, and within a few weeks, they noticed a significant improvement in their ability to concentrate and remember things. 

Now, Mark was able to teach with ease, Sarah was overflowing with new ideas for her book, and Emily and Jack were acing their exams. They were grateful to the doctor for diagnosing their health concern and helping them get back to their intellectual best.
