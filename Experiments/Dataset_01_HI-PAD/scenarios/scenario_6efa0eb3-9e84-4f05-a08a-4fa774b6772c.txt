In the year 2065, the interstellar community was thriving with diverse species coexisting and trading resources. However, tensions rose in South Asia when the ruling government announced a new educational policy that favored their own species over others. This caused an uproar among the interstellar community, with protests erupting across the region. The political unrest soon escalated, with some species even threatening to cut off trade with South Asia altogether. In the midst of all this chaos, a group of educators found themselves trapped in a shower room at a local school, seeking refuge from the violent clashes outside. They realized that their educational domain was not exempt from the political turmoil surrounding them, and they knew they had to find a way to contribute to the resolution of the conflict. As they huddled together, they brainstormed ideas for promoting interstellar unity and equality in education, hoping that their efforts would make a difference in the larger political landscape.
