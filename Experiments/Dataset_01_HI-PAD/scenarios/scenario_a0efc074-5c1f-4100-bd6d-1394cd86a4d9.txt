Riya and her chosen family were having a heated argument about the concept of free education in South Asia. They all had different opinions on whether education should be entirely free or not, and the conversation was getting quite heated.

Riya argued passionately that education should be free for everyone, regardless of their socio-economic status. She believed that education was a fundamental right, and it was the government's responsibility to provide it to its citizens.

However, her chosen family members disagreed with her. They argued that free education was not feasible in the current economic climate, and the government could not afford it. They also believed that education should be merit-based, and only those who could prove their academic abilities should be entitled to free education.

As the argument continued, tensions rose, and voices were raised. Riya began to feel frustrated and upset, as she felt like nobody was listening to her perspective. She knew that education had been a determining factor in her life, and she wanted everyone to have access to the same opportunities she had.

Eventually, the group decided to take a break from the discussion and come back to it later when they were all feeling calmer. Riya took some time to reflect on the argument and realized that while she was passionate about the issue, she needed to be more open to other perspectives. She also recognized that her chosen family members had valid points, and that finding a compromise was the best way forward.

When they reconvened, they were able to have a more productive conversation. They agreed that while free education might not be entirely feasible, there should be more opportunities for scholarships and financial aid to ensure that everyone had access to education. They also agreed that academic merit should be considered, but that there should be support for those who needed it.

In the end, the argument brought them closer together, as they were able to have a respectful and productive discussion. They may not have agreed entirely, but they were able to find common ground and work towards a solution that would benefit everyone.
