In a small village in Subsaharan Africa, the chosen family had been living together for generations. They had a strong bond that transcended blood relations. They relied on each other for everything from food to emotional support. One day, a technological failure occurred that shook the very foundations of their philosophical beliefs. The village's only source of clean water, a filtration system, had broken down. No one knew how to fix it, and the water supply was quickly running out. Panic set in as they realized the severity of the situation. They had always believed in the power of human connection, but now they were forced to confront the limitations of their chosen family. They needed outside help, and an inquiry was made into finding someone who could repair the filtration system. As they waited for a solution, the chosen family began to question their beliefs and wonder if relying solely on themselves was enough in a catastrophic situation like this.
