The extended family had gathered at the cabin in the woods for a weekend getaway. As they sat around the fire, sipping on hot cocoa, a disagreement arose between two cousins about the best way to start a fire. One cousin insisted on using lighter fluid, while the other argued that it was dangerous and preferred to use kindling. The argument escalated into a heated debate, with other family members taking sides. Eventually, they decided to settle their dispute by having a friendly competition to see who could start a fire faster without any assistance. The cousins bonded over the challenge and shared a laugh as they both successfully started a fire using their preferred methods. In the end, the disagreement brought the family closer together and reminded them of the importance of physical bonding experiences.
