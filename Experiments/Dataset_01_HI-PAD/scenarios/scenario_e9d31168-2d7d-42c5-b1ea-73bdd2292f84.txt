In a small village in Subsaharan Africa, the chosen family had always relied on technology to survive. They had a system in place where they would offer their intellectual services to a nearby city in exchange for access to new technologies. One day, a catastrophic technological failure occurred, causing the entire city to lose all of their data and intellectual property. The chosen family's offer was no longer of any value, and they found themselves struggling to survive without modern technology. They were forced to adapt to a completely different way of life, relying on their traditional practices and knowledge to survive. The failure of technology not only affected their ability to trade with the city, but it also disrupted their communication with the outside world, leaving them isolated and vulnerable. The chosen family had to come together and find a way to overcome this challenge to ensure their survival in the face of this unexpected catastrophe.
