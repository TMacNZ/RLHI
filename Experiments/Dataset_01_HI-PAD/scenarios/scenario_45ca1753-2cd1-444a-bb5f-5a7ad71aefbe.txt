In a remote village in Subsaharan Africa, a group of people gather to discuss the latest news from their interstellar brethren. They have been given a message of hope and courage in the face of an insignificant threat to their survival. The villagers have been warned of a small asteroid that will pass through their solar system, but it poses no danger to their planet or way of life. The message is a reminder that their spiritual and religious beliefs will guide them through any mundane issue that arises. They take comfort in knowing that their faith will keep them strong, no matter what the universe throws their way.
