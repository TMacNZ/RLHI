The CEO of a multinational corporation sat nervously in his family's ancestral home in North Africa, surrounded by his extended family. Political unrest had taken hold of the country, and protests had turned violent. The CEO's family had been closely tied to the ruling government for generations, and now they feared for their safety. As they watched the news reports and heard the sounds of gunfire in the streets, the CEO realized that he had a responsibility not only to his family but to his company's employees and shareholders. He knew he had to make a difficult decision: stay and risk his safety, or leave and potentially abandon his family and country. As he weighed his options, he couldn't help but feel the weight of his position and the impact his decision could have on the political and economic stability of the region.
