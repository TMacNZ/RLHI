In the year 2156, a note was discovered on a remote planet in the Andromeda galaxy, indicating the presence of advanced alien technology. A team of European scientists was sent to investigate, but upon arrival, they quickly realized that the technology was not only beyond their comprehension, but also posed a grave threat to their lives. A heated disagreement broke out between the team members, with some arguing to abandon the mission and others insisting on staying to unlock the secrets of the technology. As their argument escalated, they failed to notice the warning signs of an impending disaster. Suddenly, the planet's atmosphere began to shift, and a massive storm engulfed the area, causing irreparable damage to the team's equipment and endangering their lives. With limited resources and no way to communicate with their home base, the team must put aside their differences and work together to survive the deadly storm and find a way to escape the planet before it's too late.
