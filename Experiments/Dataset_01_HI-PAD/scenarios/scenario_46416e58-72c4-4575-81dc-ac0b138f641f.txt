In South Asia, a family of four is facing a life-threatening health concern due to the environmental impact of cigarette smoke. Despite the father's addiction to smoking, the mother has always tried to protect her children from secondhand smoke by keeping the windows open and encouraging her husband to smoke outside. However, the toxic air pollution in their region has only worsened over time, and now the family's health is at risk. Recently, the youngest child has been experiencing respiratory issues, and the doctor has linked it to the constant exposure to cigarette smoke. The family is now forced to confront the harsh reality of their situation and take drastic measures to protect their health, including considering relocation to a less polluted area and helping the father quit smoking for good.
