In Subsaharan Africa, a chosen family living near a wildlife reserve faces an annoying risk due to the ongoing conflict between local farmers and wild animals. The community relies on the natural resources surrounding them for their livelihood, but the presence of elephants and other large animals has led to destruction of crops and property. The situation has escalated to the point where some farmers have resorted to violence against the animals, further aggravating the conflict. The chosen family, who have lived in the area for generations and have a close relationship with the land, feel caught in the middle. They fear for the safety of both their crops and the animals, which they view as sacred. The constant tension and uncertainty has taken a toll on their mental and emotional well-being, as well as their financial stability. The family longs for a peaceful resolution to the conflict and a way to coexist with the animals without putting their own livelihoods at risk.
