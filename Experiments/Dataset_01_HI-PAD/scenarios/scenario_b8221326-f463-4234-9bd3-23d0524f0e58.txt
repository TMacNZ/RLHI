In the year 2050, intergalactic travel had become a common occurrence, and space bikes were a popular mode of transportation. However, in South Asia, an ethical dilemma had arisen. The region had become a hub for space bike manufacturing, but it was discovered that the production process involved exploiting the labor of underprivileged communities. These workers, who hailed from impoverished backgrounds, were made to work for long hours in hazardous conditions for very little pay. The situation had become critical, and there was widespread outrage among the public. While the manufacturers argued that they were providing employment opportunities to these communities, it was clear that the workers were not being treated fairly. The social impact of this issue was enormous, as it was causing a rift within the community and raising questions about the morality of the industry. The government was under immense pressure to take action and address the situation, but they were also wary of damaging the economy. It was a complex problem that required a delicate balance between the interests of the workers, the manufacturers, and the nation as a whole.
