In a small village nestled on the coast of the Pacific, an ethical dilemma has arisen. The local government has proposed a new policy that would allow for the construction of a large factory in the heart of the village, promising to bring jobs and economic growth. However, the factory would operate 24/7, producing a constant noise that would disrupt the sleep of the entire village. The villagers are torn between their desire for economic prosperity and their need for peaceful rest. Some argue that the jobs and money brought by the factory would be worth the sacrifice of sleep, while others maintain that a good night's rest is essential to their well-being and quality of life. As the debate rages on, the villagers must weigh the benefits and costs of the proposed policy and decide whether the potential economic gain is worth the loss of sleep.
