Approximately 14 billion years ago, the universe began with the Big Bang. However, in the present day, a serious natural disaster has struck the Middle East, causing political turmoil on a cosmic scale. A massive asteroid impact has caused catastrophic destruction in the region, with the impact zone stretching for hundreds of kilometers. The asteroid impact has triggered a series of earthquakes and tsunamis that have devastated coastal cities in the region, causing widespread death and destruction. The impact has also caused a massive dust cloud to spread across the Middle East, severely impacting air quality and making it difficult for rescue operations to take place. The severity of the disaster has led to political tensions between neighboring countries, as they compete for resources and aid to deal with the aftermath of the disaster. The cosmic scale of the disaster has brought attention to the fragility of life on Earth, and the urgent need for international cooperation to address global challenges.
