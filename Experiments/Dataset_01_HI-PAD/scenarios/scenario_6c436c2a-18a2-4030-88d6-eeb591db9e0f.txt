In the year 3057, an argument erupted between the leading Intergalactic Economic Council and the North American government over an ethical dilemma. The council had proposed a new economic policy that would allow companies to exploit the resources of newly discovered planets without regard for the native species or their environment. The North American government vehemently opposed the policy, citing the need to preserve the natural balance of the universe and protect the rights of sentient beings. The argument escalated into a long-lasting dispute, with both sides refusing to budge. As a result, the economic growth of North America was hindered, and the Intergalactic Economic Council faced backlash from other regions who supported the North American stance. The dispute ultimately sparked a larger conversation about the ethical implications of economic policies in space and the need for a universal ethical code to govern intergalactic economic practices.
