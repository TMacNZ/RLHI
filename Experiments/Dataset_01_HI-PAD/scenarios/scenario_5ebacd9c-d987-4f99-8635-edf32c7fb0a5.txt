The extended family had gathered for a joyous occasion at their ancestral home in North Africa. As they sat down for a celebratory feast, a deafening explosion rocked the house, shattering windows and sending plates and glasses flying in all directions. The family members scrambled for cover, their faces etched with fear and confusion. When the dust settled, they emerged to find their once-beautiful garden reduced to a wasteland of rubble and debris. The bombing had caused irreversible damage to the environment, with trees uprooted, soil contaminated, and wildlife decimated. The family was left reeling, wondering how they would ever recover from this devastating blow. As they mourned their loss, they also wondered what kind of world they were living in, where such atrocities could be committed with such callous disregard for human life and the natural world.
