In South America, a disruptive issue has arisen in the educational domain that is affecting anyone who is trying to pursue higher education. The problem lies in the fact that the educational institutions are facing a shortage of qualified teachers. This has led to a situation where students are not receiving the education they need to succeed in their chosen fields. The shortage of teachers is not limited to a specific region or institution, but it is a continental problem. The situation has become so dire that some schools have had to cancel classes or reduce the number of courses offered, leaving students with limited options. This is a mundane issue that is having a significant impact on the lives of those pursuing education in South America.
