In the vast expanse of the universe, there exists a civilization on a distant planet that has developed a unique system of intellectual rating. This rating system determines an individual's worth and place in society. However, this system has become disruptive and has led to increasing conflict and violence among the inhabitants of this planet. The rating system has created a rigid hierarchy, where those with high ratings have unlimited privileges and power, while those with low ratings are oppressed and discriminated against. The people of North America have been monitoring this situation, concerned about the impact this system may have on neighboring planets. They have sent a team of experts to investigate and find a resolution to this cosmic problem, hoping to restore peace and equality to this society.
