It was a beautiful summer day and John, together with his chosen family, decided to take a trip to a quaint European village. They were all looking forward to it and were excited to explore the charming streets and indulge in the local cuisine. However, their plans were disrupted when John's phone suddenly died, leaving them without access to their digital map and other important information. They tried to revive it, but to no avail. Despite the minor setback, they decided to continue with their adventure and rely on their instincts to guide them. As they wandered through the winding streets, they stumbled upon a small electronic repair shop. The technician was able to quickly fix John's phone and the group was able to continue with their plans, feeling grateful for the unexpected rest that allowed them to appreciate the simple pleasures of the village.
