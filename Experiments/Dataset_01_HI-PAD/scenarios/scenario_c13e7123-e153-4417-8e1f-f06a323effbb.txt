It was a typical day for Anna and her chosen family in Europe, until news of political unrest broke out. They were all gathered around the TV, watching as the news anchor shared details of the demonstration that had turned violent within a matter of minutes. Anna's heart sank as she saw footage of police officers using force against the protestors, and heard the sound of sirens blaring in the background. She knew that this could have a ripple effect on the social domain of their community, and feared for the safety of her loved ones. As they sat there in silence, Anna felt a sense of urgency to reach out to her friends and acquaintances, to make sure they were all okay and to offer support if needed. In that moment, she realized how important her chosen family was to her, and how they could rely on each other in times of crisis.
