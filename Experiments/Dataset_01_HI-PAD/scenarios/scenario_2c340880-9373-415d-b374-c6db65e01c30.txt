In Eurasia, a technological distinction has caused annoyance and led to conflict and violence on a national level. The government has implemented a new system that requires all citizens to use a specific type of software for communication and data storage. However, this software is not compatible with many devices and programs that people have already been using. This has caused frustration and inconvenience for individuals and businesses, with many complaining about lost data and disrupted communication. The government has refused to make any changes or accommodations, leading to protests and even riots in some areas. The situation has become increasingly tense, with some groups calling for a complete overhaul of the government's technology policies. As the conflict continues to escalate, concerns have arisen about the potential impact on the region's economy and stability.
