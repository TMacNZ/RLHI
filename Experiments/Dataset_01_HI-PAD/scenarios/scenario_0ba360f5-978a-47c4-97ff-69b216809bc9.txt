However, a financial crisis struck when one of the major moon mining companies went bankrupt, leaving thousands of workers stranded on the lunar surface without pay. The legal battle that ensued was complex, as the company had operations based in the Pacific and was subject to international laws. The workers and their families back on Earth rallied together to demand compensation, while the company's executives tried to salvage what they could from the bankruptcy. As the situation dragged on, tensions rose between the workers and the company, resulting in protests and even violence. The world watched as this interstellar financial crisis unfolded, wondering what it would mean for the future of moon mining and interstellar commerce.
