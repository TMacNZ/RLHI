As the chief financial officer of a major online marketplace in Eurasia, you have been hit hard by a severe financial crisis that threatens the very existence of your company. The crisis has been caused by a philosophical shift in the way people view online transactions, with many consumers now preferring to support local businesses instead of buying from large, multinational corporations. This has led to a steep decline in sales for your company, and you are struggling to keep up with the mounting debts and dwindling resources. The situation has become life-threatening, and you are faced with the difficult decision of whether to try and weather the storm or to close your business for good. The stakes are high, and the future of your company hangs in the balance.
