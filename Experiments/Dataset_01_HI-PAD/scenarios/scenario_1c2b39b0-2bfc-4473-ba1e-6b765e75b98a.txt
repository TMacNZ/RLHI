In the year 2150, literature had become a commodity in the intergalactic market. People from all corners of the universe were eager to get their hands on the latest bestsellers, with some even willing to pay exorbitant prices for first editions. However, a financial crisis struck Eurasia, the hub of the intergalactic trade, which had a long-lasting impact on the literature market. Bookstores were forced to close down due to lack of sales, and publishers struggled to stay afloat. The physical domain of literature was hit particularly hard, with many paper mills shutting down, causing a shortage of raw materials for book production. As a result, e-books became the go-to format for reading, and the demand for physical books dropped significantly. The literature industry was forever changed by this crisis, with many writers and publishers having to adapt to the new digital landscape to survive.
