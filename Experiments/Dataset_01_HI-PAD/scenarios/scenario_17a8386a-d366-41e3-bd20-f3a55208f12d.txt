In the year 2150, humanity has established colonies across the galaxy, but the demand for cotton has caused an unforeseen environmental issue on the planet Delta-4 in the Pacific sector. The native flora and fauna have been unable to adapt to the genetically modified cotton plants brought by settlers, leading to a significant decrease in biodiversity. The issue has sparked a social debate between those who prioritize economic growth and those concerned with preserving the planet's natural resources. The typical severity of the situation has led some to downplay the issue, but others are pushing for immediate action to mitigate the effects of the cotton plants on the planet's fragile ecosystem. As the debate rages on, the fate of the planet hangs in the balance.
