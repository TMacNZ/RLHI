The city had been bustling with activity for weeks in preparation for the upcoming festival. Local businesses had been working around the clock to ensure their products were ready to be sold, and vendors had reserved their spots in the market square well in advance. However, a catastrophic environmental issue had thrown everything off schedule. A massive oil spill had occurred just outside the city, polluting the nearby river that ran through the heart of the village. The river was a vital source of water for the city, and its contamination had severe economic consequences. The festival was postponed indefinitely, and many businesses were forced to close their doors, unable to operate without access to clean water. The city's residents were in a state of panic as they watched their once-thriving community come to a standstill. It would take months, if not years, for the region to recover from the devastating effects of the oil spill.
