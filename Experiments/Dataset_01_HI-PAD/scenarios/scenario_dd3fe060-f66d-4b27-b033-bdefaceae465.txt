The defensive stance of North African politicians on environmental issues has become a growing concern for citizens. While the severity of the issue may be insignificant at present, concerns about the long-term impact of environmental degradation have been growing. Despite this, politicians in the region have been hesitant to take any meaningful action to address the issue, instead opting for defensive posturing and vague promises of action. This has led to frustration among citizens, who feel that their leaders are not taking the issue seriously enough. As the effects of climate change become more pronounced, it remains to be seen whether North African politicians will step up and take the necessary action to protect the environment and the future of their citizens.
