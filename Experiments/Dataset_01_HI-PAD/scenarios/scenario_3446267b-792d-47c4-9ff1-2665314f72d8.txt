While the issue is not new, the severity of the problem has been increasing in recent years, making it difficult for families to go about their daily lives. This disruptive situation is especially concerning for families with young children or elderly members who are more vulnerable to the harmful effects of pollution. Despite the challenges, families are finding ways to stay positive and remain friendly towards one another, even as they navigate the difficult environmental conditions. From wearing masks to investing in air purifiers, families are doing their best to protect their health and stay connected with one another in the face of this ongoing challenge.
