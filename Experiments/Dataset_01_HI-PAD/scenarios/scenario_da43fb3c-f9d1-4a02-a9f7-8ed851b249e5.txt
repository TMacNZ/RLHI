The COVID-19 pandemic forced schools in Asia to shift their learning online, leaving many students struggling to adapt to the new format. For students from spiritual or religious backgrounds, the situation became even more serious. Not only were they missing out on in-person community and support, but they were also unable to attend important religious ceremonies and events that were crucial to their learning and growth. As natural disasters continued to ravage the region, including devastating floods and typhoons, the sense of disconnection and isolation felt by these students only deepened. Despite these challenges, however, many found comfort in connecting with their religious communities virtually and continuing their learning through online resources and guidance from their spiritual leaders.
