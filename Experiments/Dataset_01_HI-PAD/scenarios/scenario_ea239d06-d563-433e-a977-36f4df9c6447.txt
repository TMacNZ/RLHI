In a small village in rural South Asia, two close friends run a small grocery store together. One of the friends, however, has been secretly calculating the profits and taking a larger share for himself. The other friend begins to suspect that something is amiss when he notices that the profits seem lower than what they should be. After doing some investigating, he discovers his friend's scheme and is faced with an ethical dilemma. He wants to confront his friend about the unfair distribution of profits, but he knows that it will create a disruptive situation and potentially damage their friendship. On the other hand, he cannot continue to allow his friend to take advantage of their partnership. As he weighs his options, he realizes that this is not just a matter of money, but also of trust and integrity.
