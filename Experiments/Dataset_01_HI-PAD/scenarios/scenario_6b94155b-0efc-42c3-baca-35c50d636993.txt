In the Middle East, a philosophical disagreement has arisen regarding the role of control in society. Some argue that control is necessary for a functioning society, while others believe that it stifles individual freedom and creativity. The debate has not yet reached a level of severity that threatens the region's stability, but it has caused tension between those who favor more control and those who advocate for less. Both sides have presented compelling arguments, and the disagreement continues to be discussed in academic and intellectual circles. Despite the disagreement, there is a shared commitment to finding a solution that will allow for a balance between control and freedom in society.
