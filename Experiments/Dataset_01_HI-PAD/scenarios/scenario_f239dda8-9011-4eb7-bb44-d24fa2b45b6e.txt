In the year 2050, humanity had made significant progress in intergalactic travel, and the first-ever colony was established on a distant planet. However, this created a major issue back on Earth, specifically in Subsaharan Africa. With many of the resources being directed towards space exploration, the region faced a severe shortage of resources, including food. The governments of the affected countries were left with no choice but to seek legal action against the intergalactic agencies to ensure that the people of the region were adequately fed. The situation had become a social challenge, with protests and riots breaking out across the region due to the lack of provisions. The governments had to come up with a plan to address the issue, and legal action was just one of the many measures taken to ensure that the people were not left to starve.
