Over the past decade, there has been a growing concern in North Africa regarding the impact of online spiritual and religious content on people's health. With the rise of social media and easy access to online information, there has been an increase in the spread of extremist religious ideologies, leading to radicalization and violence. Additionally, there has been a rise in the spread of pseudoscientific health remedies, which can be dangerous and harmful to individuals. This has led to a call for greater regulation of online spiritual and religious content, as well as increased education on how to identify and avoid harmful content. In response, various organizations have launched awareness campaigns and initiatives to promote safe and healthy online behavior, emphasizing the importance of critical thinking and fact-checking when it comes to spiritual and health-related information found online. While progress has been made, there is still much work to be done in addressing the complex intersection of spirituality, religion, and online behavior in North Africa.
