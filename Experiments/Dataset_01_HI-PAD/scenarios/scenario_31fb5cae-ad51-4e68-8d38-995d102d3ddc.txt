Asma and her chosen family in North Africa were facing a financial crisis. They had been struggling to make ends meet for a few months and were constantly worried about how they were going to make their next rent payment. Asma, who had been trying to find a way to make some extra money, received a text from a friend about a new job opportunity. The job required her to work from home and involved typing out a large amount of text in a short amount of time. Asma was hesitant at first, but her chosen family encouraged her to give it a try. With their support, Asma applied for the job and was accepted. Over the next few weeks, Asma worked hard and was able to earn enough money to cover their rent and other expenses. Her chosen family was grateful for her hard work and dedication, and they were able to breathe a sigh of relief knowing that they would be able to make it through the financial crisis. While the text from her friend may have seemed insignificant at first, it ended up being a lifeline for Asma and her chosen family during a difficult time.
