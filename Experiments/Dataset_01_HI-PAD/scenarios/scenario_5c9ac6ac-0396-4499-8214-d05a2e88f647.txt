The devastating flood in Subsaharan Africa had caused a serious interpersonal conflict between two onion farmers. The flood had wiped out most of the crops in the region, leaving only a few surviving fields. The two farmers, who had been neighbors for years, were now in a legal dispute over the remaining onion fields. The severity of the situation was heightened by the fact that onions were the main source of income for both farmers. The legal battle had become so intense that the entire community was now involved, taking sides and causing tensions to rise. The local government was struggling to mediate the issue, as it had become a complex matter of land ownership, crop rights, and compensation for loss. The fate of the two farmers and their families hung in the balance, as the legal battle dragged on with no clear resolution in sight.
