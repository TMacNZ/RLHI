A multinational corporation based in Europe recently decided to hire several employees in their South American branch. However, during the screening process, it was discovered that there was a serious health concern in the region related to a social issue. Reports showed that there was a high incidence of a particular disease in the area due to poor sanitation practices and lack of access to clean water. The corporation was faced with a difficult decision as they weighed the risks of sending their employees to work in this region. They knew that they could not compromise the health and safety of their staff, but they also did not want to miss out on the business opportunities in the region. The corporation ultimately decided to move forward with caution, implementing strict health and safety protocols for their employees and partnering with local organizations to address the health concern.
