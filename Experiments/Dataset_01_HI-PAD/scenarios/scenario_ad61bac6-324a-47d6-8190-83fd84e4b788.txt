In many parts of Asia, the online world has become a double-edged sword for former students. While it has provided opportunities for growth and learning, it has also become a breeding ground for social challenges that can be life-threatening. The educational system in many Asian countries is highly competitive, and students are often under immense pressure to perform well. This pressure can lead to mental health issues and a feeling of isolation. In some cases, former students who are unable to cope with the stress may turn to online communities that promote self-harm or suicide. These communities often glorify these actions and encourage others to follow suit. As a result, many Asian countries are struggling to find ways to protect their former students from the dangers of online radicalisation and social challenges.
