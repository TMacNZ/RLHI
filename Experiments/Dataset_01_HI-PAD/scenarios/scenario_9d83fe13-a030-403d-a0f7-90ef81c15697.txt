In the Middle East, the rate of political unrest has been increasing at an alarming rate. This has caused disruptive effects on the technological domain, as businesses struggle to operate in a volatile environment. With frequent protests, strikes, and even violent clashes, it has become increasingly difficult for companies to maintain a stable workforce, let alone attract new talent. This has led to a shortage of skilled workers, resulting in a decline in productivity and revenue. As a result, businesses are being forced to adapt their strategies to the ever-changing political landscape. Some have even resorted to relocating their operations to more stable regions, causing an economic downturn in the Middle East. The severity of the situation cannot be ignored, and it is imperative for political leaders to address the underlying issues causing the unrest to prevent further disruption to the technological domain and the wider economy.
