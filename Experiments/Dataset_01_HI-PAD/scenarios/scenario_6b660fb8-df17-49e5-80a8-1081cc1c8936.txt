In the remote village of South Asia, a nuclear family was left devastated after a serious technological failure resulted in the loss of their only mode of transportation. The family car, which had been an integral part of their daily routine, had broken down and was beyond repair. This failure had a significant emotional impact on the family as they were unable to accompany their children to school, attend important family events, and carry out daily tasks that required transportation. The parents were forced to walk long distances to buy groceries and essentials, while the children struggled to attend school regularly. The family felt isolated and helpless in their situation, as they were unable to afford a new car. The emotional toll of this technological failure left the family feeling helpless and disconnected from their community. They longed for a solution that would allow them to regain their independence and restore their sense of normalcy.
