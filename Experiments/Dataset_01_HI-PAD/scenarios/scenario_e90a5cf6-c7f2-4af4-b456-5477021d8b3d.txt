The judgment was palpable as Maria and her best friend Carla sat across from each other at the caf√© in downtown Buenos Aires. Maria had made a comment that Carla found offensive, and now the air between them was thick with tension. As they sipped their coffee, neither could look the other in the eye. Maria regretted her words, but Carla's reaction was over the top. She started to feel angry and hurt, and the longer Carla stayed silent, the more it stoked the fire of resentment inside Maria. The argument that ensued was heated and emotional, and it left both women feeling drained and upset. Weeks turned into months without them speaking, and the once-close friends were now strangers. The judgment they both held against each other had caused irreparable damage, leaving them with a long-lasting rift that neither knew how to heal.
