The decrease in intellectual health concerns among North Americans has become a growing issue online. With the rise of social media and the constant bombardment of information, people are struggling to maintain their cognitive abilities. The irreversible effects of this decrease are alarming, as individuals are finding it increasingly difficult to focus, remember details, and engage in critical thinking. This is especially concerning in a society where information is readily available at our fingertips. While there are efforts being made to combat this issue, such as mindfulness practices and brain training apps, it remains a pressing concern for the future of intellectual health in North America.
