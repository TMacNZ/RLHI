In the South Pacific, a frequent environmental issue is the disposal of waste within extended family compounds. While this is a relatively insignificant problem compared to larger environmental concerns, it can still have negative impacts on the social dynamics within the family. With limited resources and infrastructure for waste management, many family members resort to burning or burying their rubbish on the compound. This can lead to unpleasant odors and attract pests, causing tension between family members who share the same living space. Additionally, improper waste disposal can contribute to pollution and harm the surrounding ecosystem. To address this issue, some families have implemented composting systems or designated areas for waste disposal, emphasizing the importance of sustainability and responsibility to future generations.
