Rakesh was a software engineer at a tech firm in South Asia. He had been working on a critical project for the past few weeks and was almost ready to present it to his boss. However, as soon as he switched on his computer, he realized that it had crashed.

He tried restarting it multiple times, but it was unresponsive. This was not the first time this had happened, and he was extremely frustrated. Rakesh knew that he had to get his computer fixed before the presentation, but he didn't have the time to waste on it.

He decided to call the IT department, and they sent a technician over within an hour. The technician tried to fix the computer, but it was still not working. Rakesh was getting increasingly annoyed and started arguing with the technician.

He insisted that the technician fix the issue immediately, but the technician explained that it was a hardware problem and would take some time to fix. Rakesh was not ready to accept this explanation and continued arguing, which only made the situation worse.

The argument escalated, and Rakesh's boss got involved. He tried to mediate the situation and asked Rakesh to calm down. However, Rakesh was not ready to listen and continued to argue.

Finally, the technician managed to fix the computer, and Rakesh was able to complete his project. However, the argument had left a bad taste in everyone's mouth, and Rakesh realized that he needed to work on his communication and anger management skills.
