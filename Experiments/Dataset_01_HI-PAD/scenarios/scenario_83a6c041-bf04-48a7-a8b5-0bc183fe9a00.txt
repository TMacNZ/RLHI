In the Middle East, there is a myth that has been passed down through generations of an extended family. According to the legend, the land upon which their ancestors built their homes was granted to them by the gods, and as such, it was their responsibility to protect and preserve it. However, over time, this myth has become a long-lasting environmental issue. The once fertile land has become barren due to years of over-farming and neglect, and the family is struggling to make ends meet. Despite their best efforts, they are unable to revive the land, and tensions within the family are rising as they argue over whose responsibility it is to take action. The local political leaders have also become involved, as the issue is affecting the surrounding communities. The family is now faced with the daunting task of finding a solution that will not only revive their land but also preserve it for future generations.
