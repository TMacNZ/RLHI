In Eurasia, a mundane issue has been causing annoyance among farmers across the region. Due to a recent lack of rainfall, crops have been struggling to grow and yield the expected harvest. This issue has not only affected the livelihoods of farmers but has also caused concern among those with spiritual or religious beliefs. Many have turned to prayer and rituals in hopes of bringing rain to the dry lands, while others have been left to wonder if this is a sign from a higher power. As the issue persists on a global scale, individuals are left to ponder the connection between their faith and the natural world.
