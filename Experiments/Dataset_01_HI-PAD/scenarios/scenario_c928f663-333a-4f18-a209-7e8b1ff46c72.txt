Roughly one hundred years ago, Earth's resources were depleted to a dangerous level. The world leaders came together to find a solution and decided to embark on an intergalactic mission to find a new planet for human habitation. After years of searching, they finally found a planet with the right environment and resources to sustain human life. They named it New Earth and started building colonies on the planet.

The first colony was established in Subsaharan Africa, where the conditions were similar to those on New Earth. The people who were selected to move to the new planet were carefully chosen based on their skills and ability to adapt to the new environment. They were trained to survive in the harsh conditions of the new planet and were given the necessary tools and equipment to build their new homes.

However, the colonists soon realized that they were not alone on the planet. There were other creatures living there, some of which were life-threatening. The colonists had to learn to coexist with these creatures and find a way to protect themselves from them.

The biggest challenge the colonists faced was the environmental conditions. The planet was prone to rough weather and natural disasters, which made it difficult to grow crops and raise livestock. The colonists had to rely on technology to sustain their food supply and had to constantly innovate to find new ways to survive.

As time passed, the colonists started to form their own society and culture. They developed a deep respect for the planet and its resources, and they learned to live in harmony with nature. They also started to reach out to other colonies on New Earth and form alliances to ensure the survival of their species.

Despite the challenges they faced, the colonists persevered and built a new home on New Earth. They realized that their survival depended on their ability to adapt to their new environment and work together to overcome the challenges they faced.
