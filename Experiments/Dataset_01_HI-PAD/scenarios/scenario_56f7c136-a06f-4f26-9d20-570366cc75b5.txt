In North Africa, a legal ethical dilemma has arisen. A group of individuals have taken it upon themselves to illegally smuggle goods across the continental borders. What started as a small operation has grown into a large-scale operation involving many individuals. The severity of the situation is critical as the goods being smuggled are illegal and could cause harm to society. The individuals involved are facing a moral dilemma as they feel they are doing what they need to do to survive. However, their actions could have serious consequences for themselves and the region. The legal domain is now involved, trying to put an end to the illegal smuggling operation and bring the individuals responsible to justice.
