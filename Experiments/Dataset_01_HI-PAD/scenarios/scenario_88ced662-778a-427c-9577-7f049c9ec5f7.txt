Two prominent philosophers from different universities in the South Pacific had been engaged in an online debate for weeks. Their disagreement on the nature of reality had been escalating, with each trying to prove their opponent's theory wrong. As the argument grew more intense, insults were exchanged, and personal attacks were made. The debate had turned into a bitter rivalry, with both scholars determined to prove the other wrong. One day, during a particularly heated exchange, one of the philosophers made a statement that was seen as deeply offensive by the other. In a fit of anger, the offended philosopher published a scathing rebuttal, effectively ending the debate. However, the damage had been done. The online community was divided, with some supporting one philosopher, and others supporting the other. The impact of this disagreement on the philosophical community was irreversible, as it had created a rift between two once-respected academics.
