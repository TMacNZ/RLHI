In South America, a serious problem is brewing with the role of architects in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The national government has been investing heavily in AI technology, but there have been concerns about the architects designing these systems. Many have been accused of prioritizing profit over safety measures, leading to potentially dangerous outcomes. The government has formed a task force to investigate and regulate the work of architects in the AI industry to prevent any catastrophic consequences. The task force is working closely with experts in the field to establish guidelines and regulations that prioritize safety and ethical considerations. The hope is that these measures will prevent any potential harm caused by AI systems designed by architects who prioritize profit over safety.
