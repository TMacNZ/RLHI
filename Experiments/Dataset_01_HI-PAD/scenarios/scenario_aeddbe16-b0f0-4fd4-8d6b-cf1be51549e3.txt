It was a mental strain for the entire extended family when Aunt Fatima accidentally spilled a hot pot of tea on Uncle Ahmed during their weekly family gathering. The incident happened in the living room of their home in the Middle East, causing Uncle Ahmed to jump up in pain and shock. The hot tea splashed all over his clothes and left him with first-degree burns on his arms and chest. Everyone rushed to his aid, trying to cool down the burns with cold water and ointments. Aunt Fatima was devastated and couldn't stop apologizing for her mistake. Although Uncle Ahmed assured her that it was just an annoyance and that he would be fine, the mental distress of the accident lingered throughout the evening, overshadowing the usual warmth and joy of their family gatherings.
