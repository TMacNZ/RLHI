As a Pacific islander, baking has always been a stress-relieving activity for me. However, recently, I've been facing a constant annoyance every time I try to bake. My oven has been malfunctioning, and every time I bake, the temperature fluctuates and ruins my baked goods. As a result, I've been wasting ingredients and money trying to perfect my recipes. Unfortunately, with the ongoing financial crisis, I can't afford to replace my oven. I've tried to troubleshoot the issue and even called a technician, but nothing seems to work. It's frustrating to see my passion for baking being hindered by a technological problem that I can't seem to fix. Nevertheless, I refuse to give up, and I've been looking for alternative ways to bake, such as using a toaster oven or even trying out stovetop baking techniques. Despite the annoyance, I'm determined to find a solution and continue doing what I love.
