In Subsaharan Africa, a warm ethical dilemma has been causing disruptive effects on the economic domain of the region. A group of companies has been found to be exploiting the local workforce by paying them wages below the minimum wage, and not providing them with proper working conditions. This has caused an uproar among the local population, as they have been struggling to make ends meet with the low wages they receive. However, these companies are major contributors to the economy of the region, and shutting them down could lead to severe economic consequences. The local government is stuck in a tough spot, as they need to balance the ethical concerns of the people with the economic growth of the region. The situation has caused a lot of tension and debates among the stakeholders involved, and a solution that satisfies everyone seems hard to come by.
