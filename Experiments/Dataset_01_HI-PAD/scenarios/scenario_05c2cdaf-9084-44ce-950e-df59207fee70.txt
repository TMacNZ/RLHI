In a far-off galaxy, a catastrophic event was unfolding in the Eurasian sector. A routine cognitive assessment of the inhabitants of a nearby planet had revealed an unexpected emotional issue. The otherwise mundane issue had escalated to a point of no return, threatening the entire intergalactic community. The inhabitants of the planet had always been known for their exceptional cognitive abilities, but it appeared that their emotional intelligence was severely lacking. As a result, they were unable to manage their emotions, leading to irrational behavior and decisions that had catastrophic consequences for their planet and neighboring galaxies. The intergalactic council was now facing a daunting task of finding a solution to this unexpected problem before it spiraled out of control and endangered the entire universe.
