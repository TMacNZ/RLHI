In the year 2050, iron had become a valuable resource in the intergalactic market, with many planets relying on it for their technological advancements. However, the North African region was facing an annoyance in their iron export industry. The financial crisis had hit hard, and the demand for iron had decreased significantly, resulting in a surplus of the metal. The environmental impact was devastating as the excess iron waste was piling up, and the authorities were struggling to manage it. The community was feeling the brunt of this crisis as unemployment rates skyrocketed, and many businesses shut down. The government was desperately trying to find a solution to this problem, reaching out to other planets to increase their exports. In the meantime, the people of North Africa were left to deal with the environmental consequences of this financial crisis, hoping for a solution to come soon.
