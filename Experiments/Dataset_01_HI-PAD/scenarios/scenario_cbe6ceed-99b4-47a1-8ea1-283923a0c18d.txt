In a remote corner of Subsaharan Africa, a group of students eagerly awaited their weekly video conference with their intergalactic mentor. They had been studying advanced astrophysics and were excited to learn about the latest discoveries in the field. However, as the scheduled time for the conference approached, they noticed that their video screen remained blank. They tried multiple times to establish a connection, but all their attempts failed. It soon became clear that there was a technological failure at play. The students were devastated, as they had been looking forward to this conference for weeks. They knew that they would have to wait until next week to get a chance to speak to their mentor again. This failure highlighted the need for better technological infrastructure in the educational domain, especially in remote regions where access to information and resources is limited.
