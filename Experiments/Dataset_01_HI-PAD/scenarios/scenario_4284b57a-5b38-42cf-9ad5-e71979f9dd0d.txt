In a small village on a remote island in the South Pacific, a nuclear family is facing an irreversible financial crisis. The father, a fisherman, used to rely on the rare, exotic fish he caught to make a living. However, due to overfishing and climate change, the fish population has drastically decreased, leaving him with few options to support his family. The mother, a weaver, used to sell her cultural crafts to tourists, but with travel restrictions in place, her income has also dwindled. The family is struggling to make ends meet, and their cultural traditions and way of life are at risk of disappearing. They fear that they may have to leave their home and community in search of a better life elsewhere, which would mean leaving behind their ancestors and everything they hold dear.
