In the Middle East, a catastrophic conflict has erupted over the issue of mortgages. The government has introduced a new national mortgage policy that is seen as a direct attack on the religious beliefs of many in the region. The policy allows for interest to be charged on mortgages, which is considered usury and is prohibited in Islam. This has sparked widespread protests and violence across the country, with many religious leaders calling for a holy war against the government. The situation has escalated to the point where several federal buildings have been destroyed in bombings, and the government has declared a state of emergency. The conflict has deeply divided the country along religious lines, with many fearing that it could lead to a full-blown civil war. The international community is closely monitoring the situation and trying to find a way to ease tensions, but the stakes are high, and the outcome is uncertain.
