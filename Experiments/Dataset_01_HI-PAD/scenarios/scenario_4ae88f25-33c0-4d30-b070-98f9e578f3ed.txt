In a bustling city in South Asia, a political debate was taking place in the federal assembly. Members of parliament were gathered to discuss the latest technological failure that had been causing a major annoyance among citizens. It was obvious that the issue was of national significance as it affected many people. The failure was related to the country's digital infrastructure, causing difficulties in accessing important government websites and services. This had resulted in a lot of frustration and inconvenience for the citizens. As the debate heated up, some members of parliament were blaming the government for not providing adequate funds to upgrade the infrastructure, while others argued that the private sector needed to take more responsibility. The debate was ongoing, with no clear solution in sight, leaving the citizens of South Asia to continue to suffer the consequences of the technological failure.
