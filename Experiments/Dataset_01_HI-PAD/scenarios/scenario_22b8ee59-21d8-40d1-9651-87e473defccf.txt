After months of planning and anticipation, the day had finally arrived for Sarah and John's wedding. As they exchanged their vows in front of their family and friends, the ceremony was being live-streamed to loved ones who were unable to attend. However, as soon as the officiant declared them married, the audio and video feed abruptly cut out. Confused and disappointed, Sarah and John tried to troubleshoot the issue, but to no avail. It was later discovered that the educational institution that was providing the live-streaming service had experienced a technological failure, causing the interruption. While the newlyweds were grateful for those who were able to witness their special moment in person, they couldn't help but feel disappointed that others were unable to share in their joy due to the technological mishap.
