In the year 2075, an intergalactic religious group known as the "Tomato Cult" had gained a strong following in Subsaharan Africa. Their belief system centered around the worship of tomatoes and their perceived spiritual powers. However, this group's growing influence began to cause political unrest, as their teachings clashed with traditional religious beliefs in the region. This led to protests and clashes between the Tomato Cult and opposing groups, resulting in an annoying and disruptive situation for the local population. The government struggled to maintain order and balance religious freedom with the need to keep the peace. Eventually, a compromise was reached where the Tomato Cult was allowed to practice their beliefs in designated areas, but were not allowed to proselytize or interfere with the beliefs of others. While the situation was resolved, it left a lasting impact on the region's religious and political landscape.
