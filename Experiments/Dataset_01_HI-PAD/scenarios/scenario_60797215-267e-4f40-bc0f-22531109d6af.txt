In South Asia, a cross-cultural conflict has arisen in the educational domain. Students from different countries on the continent are attending a prestigious university, but tensions have been building between them. The root of the problem is their vastly different cultural backgrounds, which have led to misunderstandings and confrontations. The severity of the conflict is currently ordinary, but there is a risk of it escalating if not addressed. The university has brought in cultural sensitivity trainers to help students understand and respect each other's cultural differences. Additionally, conflict resolution workshops are being held to teach students how to handle disputes in a peaceful and productive manner. Despite the challenges, both students and faculty remain committed to finding a solution that allows students from all cultures to thrive in their educational pursuits.
