In South Asia, spending time with chosen family members is a crucial part of daily life. However, with the rise of technology, people are finding it increasingly difficult to connect with their loved ones in person. Instead, they are spending more time on their phones and laptops, scrolling through social media and sending messages. This technological shift is creating a social challenge, as people are becoming more isolated from their families and communities. While technology can be a helpful tool for staying in touch, it is important to remember the value of face-to-face interaction and making time for those who matter most.
