As a maker, living in the South Pacific has always been a dream come true. The crystal-clear waters and the lush greenery always inspired me to create unique and sustainable art pieces that would not only be visually stunning but also eco-friendly. However, my latest project turned out to be a complete disaster. In my efforts to create a masterpiece, I used a type of resin that I thought was environmentally friendly, but it turned out to be the complete opposite. Once the resin hardened, I realized it had a toxic component that contaminated the surrounding ecosystem irreversibly. The once-thriving marine life was now dying, and the water had turned murky and polluted. I was devastated by my mistake and knew I had to take responsibility for my actions. I reached out to local environmental agencies and volunteered my time to help clean up the damage I had caused. This experience taught me the importance of researching materials thoroughly and being mindful of the impact my art has on the environment.
