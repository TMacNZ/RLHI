As a renowned educational consultant, Maria was invited to give a talk at the international conference in South America. She was excited to share her knowledge with the educators from all over the world who had gathered to attend the conference. The topic of her talk was "The Greatest Ethical Dilemma in Education." 

Maria started her talk by discussing the importance of ethics in education and how it shapes the future of society. She then went on to highlight the greatest ethical dilemma in education, which she believed was the lack of access to quality education for underprivileged children.

Maria shared some shocking statistics with the audience, stating that millions of children around the world are denied access to basic education due to various factors such as poverty, discrimination, and lack of resources. She stressed that this was not only an ethical dilemma but also a social injustice that needed to be addressed urgently.

As Maria continued her talk, she noticed some of the educators in the audience were getting visibly annoyed. She realized that her message was hitting too close to home for some of the attendees who were from developed countries that were guilty of not providing equal access to education.

Maria took a deep breath and continued her talk, urging the educators to take responsibility for their role in shaping the future of education. She suggested that they could start by supporting non-profit organizations that work towards providing education to underprivileged children, or by volunteering their time and expertise to help schools in developing countries.

Despite the initial annoyance, Maria's talk ultimately sparked a lively discussion among the educators, who acknowledged the importance of addressing this ethical dilemma in education. Maria felt proud to have made a difference, no matter how small, in the fight for equal access to quality education for all children.
