Kim was a software developer at a big firm in Asia. She had been working on a project for months and had just completed it. Her boss was thrilled with the results and told her that they would be presenting the new software to a group of potential clients the following week. However, Kim had just discovered a major ethical dilemma. While working on the project, she had come across some hidden code that could potentially harm the users of the software. She realized that if her boss presented the software to the clients without disclosing this issue, it could lead to serious financial and legal consequences for the company. Kim was torn between her loyalty to her boss and her duty to protect the users of the software. She knew that she had to speak up, but she was afraid of the repercussions. She decided to approach her boss and explain the situation, hoping that he would make the right decision.
