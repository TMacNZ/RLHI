The air in South Asia was thick with tension as political unrest continued to grip the region. The government's decision to ban the burning of crop waste, a common practice in the agricultural industry, had sparked outrage among farmers. Many viewed the ban as an attack on their cultural traditions, and the protests had grown increasingly violent. As the demonstrations continued, the danger only increased, with tear gas and rubber bullets filling the air and causing chaos in the streets. But the real danger lay in the air itself, as the thick smog from the crop burnings had caused a surge in lung-related illnesses. Hospitals were overwhelmed with patients struggling to breathe, and the government's failure to address the crisis only added to the anger and frustration of the protesters. The situation had become a powder keg, with the potential to explode at any moment.
