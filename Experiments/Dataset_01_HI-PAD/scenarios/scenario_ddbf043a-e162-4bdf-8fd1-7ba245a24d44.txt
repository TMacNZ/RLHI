In Subsaharan Africa, the grain supply chain has been disrupted due to technological conflict and violence. A group of hackers has targeted the computer systems of major grain suppliers, causing chaos in the distribution process. Farmers have been unable to sell their crops, and many are struggling to make ends meet. The situation has led to protests and violence in some areas, as people demand access to food. The government has declared a state of emergency and is working to restore the supply chain, but progress has been slow. Meanwhile, tensions continue to rise, and there are fears that the situation could escalate further. The disruption of the grain supply chain has not only affected the economy but also the daily lives of people who rely on it for sustenance.
