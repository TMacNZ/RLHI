The local community in a small Subsaharan African neighborhood was facing an annoyance due to the aftermath of a natural disaster. A recent flash flood had caused a significant amount of damage to the educational infrastructure in the area. The local school had suffered the most, with several classrooms being completely destroyed by the floodwaters. The students were now forced to attend classes in drafty and makeshift classrooms, which were not conducive to learning. The teachers were struggling to keep the students focused due to the constant flow of wind, making it difficult to hear them. The lack of proper facilities was causing a significant hindrance to the education of the children in the area. The community was working together to try and raise funds to rebuild the school, but progress was slow. In the meantime, the students were forced to attend classes in substandard conditions, which was impacting their education and overall well-being. The community knew that they needed to act fast and find a solution to this problem before it was too late.
