The circumstance that has befallen the Federal Government is one of an ethical dilemma with irreversible consequences. In an effort to secure the nation's borders, a new policy was implemented that allowed for the immediate deportation of any undocumented immigrants found within the Pacific region. However, it has recently come to light that this policy has resulted in the separation of families, with children being taken away from their parents and sent to detention centers across the country. The emotional toll that this has taken on both the families and the government officials enforcing the policy cannot be overstated. While some argue that this policy is necessary to protect the nation, others believe that it goes against the values and principles that the country was founded upon. The government must now grapple with the consequences of their actions and decide whether they are willing to sacrifice the emotional well-being of families for the sake of national security.
