A financial crisis has hit the educational domain in Europe, and the severity of the situation is dangerous. Educational institutions are facing a shortage of funds due to the replace of traditional methods with modern technologies. The cost of implementing new technologies has exceeded the estimated budget, causing institutions to suffer significant losses. As a result, many universities and schools are unable to meet their financial obligations, leading to the closure of some institutions. The situation has resulted in a significant setback for the educational sector in Europe, causing a rise in unemployment rates and a decrease in the quality of education available to the public. Urgent measures need to be taken to address the financial crisis in the educational domain before it causes irreversible damage to the future of Europe's education system.
