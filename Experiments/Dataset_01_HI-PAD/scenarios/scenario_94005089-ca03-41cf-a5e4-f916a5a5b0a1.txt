In South Asia, political unrest had been brewing for months. The tension had been building, and it finally reached a boiling point when the government announced a new policy that would affect the scientific community. The policy would require all scientists to obtain a license to conduct research, and only those approved by the government would be allowed to do so. The license would be granted based on a quota system, with each extended family being assigned a limit of ten licenses. The decision was irreversible, and it was clear that the consequences would be severe. The scientific community was outraged, and they knew that this policy would stifle innovation and progress. Families within the scientific community were torn apart, with some members supporting the government's decision and others vehemently opposing it. The situation was dire, and it seemed as though there was no end in sight to the political unrest that had gripped the region.
