As humans, we often ponder our place in the vastness of the universe and wonder about the size of our existence. Despite our insignificant size in the grand scheme of things, we are still faced with social challenges that affect our daily lives. In the Pacific region, philosophers and thinkers are grappling with the concept of individualism versus collectivism. Does the size of our individual existence matter if we are all interconnected and part of a larger collective? Can we find a balance between celebrating our unique identities and recognizing our shared humanity? These are the philosophical questions that continue to shape the social landscape of the Pacific and beyond.
