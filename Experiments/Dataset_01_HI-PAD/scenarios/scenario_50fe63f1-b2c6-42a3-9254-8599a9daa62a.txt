In a small town in South America, there lived a family who had been chosen to take care of an old telephone booth. The booth had been there for generations and had been passed down from family to family as a symbol of responsibility and trust. However, a disagreement arose when one of the family members, who was also a lawyer, claimed that the telephone booth was now a legal property and could be sold or rented for profit. This caused a rift in the family, with some members wanting to keep the tradition alive and others wanting to make a profit from the booth. The argument became so disruptive that it affected the entire community, who had grown to rely on the telephone booth as a means of communication. Eventually, the family agreed to settle the dispute in court, and it was decided that the booth would remain under the care of the original family, but with certain conditions that would allow them to use it for commercial purposes. The community was relieved that the telephone booth would remain a part of their lives, and the family was able to resolve their disagreement in a legal and fair manner.
