In South Asia, there exists a social challenge that has severe and irreversible consequences for individuals with limited skill sets. The legal domain is impacted by the lack of opportunities for those who lack the necessary skills to compete in the job market. Without access to training and education, these individuals are left to fend for themselves, unable to provide for their families and unable to break the cycle of poverty. This issue is especially prevalent in rural areas where access to education and training is limited. As a result, many individuals are forced to migrate to cities in search of work, often falling victim to exploitative labor practices. The lack of legal protection for these individuals only exacerbates the problem. It is clear that addressing this social challenge will require a concerted effort from government, NGOs, and private sector organizations to provide training and education opportunities that enable individuals to develop the skills necessary to secure meaningful employment.
