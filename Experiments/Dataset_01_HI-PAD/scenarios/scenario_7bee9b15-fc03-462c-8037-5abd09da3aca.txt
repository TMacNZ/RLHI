Almost every religious leader in the Middle East was annoyed by the recent intergalactic phenomenon they had witnessed. It was a bright and shining light that appeared in the sky for a few seconds before disappearing. Many people started to speculate that it could be a sign from the heavens, but the religious leaders were not so convinced. They argued that it was just another mundane issue and that it didn't hold any significant meaning. However, there were a few who believed that the light was a message from a higher power and that it could be a sign of an impending doom. Despite their disagreements, the religious leaders all agreed on one thing - they needed to find out what the light meant and what its purpose was.
