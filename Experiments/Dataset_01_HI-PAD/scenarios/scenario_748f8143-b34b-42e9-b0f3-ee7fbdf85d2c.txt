In a small town in Asia, there was a group of neighbors who constantly bickered and argued with each other. One particular neighbor, Mr. Lee, had a beautiful garden in front of his house, which he spent hours tending to every day. However, his next-door neighbor, Mrs. Tan, always complained about how ugly his garden was and how it ruined the aesthetic of the entire street. This constant bickering between the two neighbors annoyed everyone on the street, but they were unsure of how to resolve the issue. One day, a community meeting was held to discuss the matter, and it was decided that the town council would step in to mediate the dispute. The council members visited Mr. Lee's garden and noticed that it was indeed beautiful, but there were a few areas that could use improvement. They suggested some changes that Mr. Lee could make to enhance the garden's beauty, and they also recommended that Mrs. Tan be more considerate of her neighbor's efforts. In the end, Mr. Lee made the suggested changes, and Mrs. Tan apologized for her behavior. The issue was resolved, and the neighborhood was able to live in harmony once again.
