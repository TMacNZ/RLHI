In the midst of the European financial crisis, a philosophical debate emerged about the role of the individual in society. Some argued that each person should only look out for himself and his own financial interests, while others insisted that a collective effort was necessary to overcome the economic challenges facing the region. This debate was particularly heated in countries hardest hit by the crisis, such as Greece and Spain, where many people felt frustrated and powerless in the face of widespread unemployment and government austerity measures. Nonetheless, there were also voices of hope and unity, with many individuals and organizations coming together to support one another and work towards a brighter future for all. Despite the annoyance and uncertainty caused by the crisis, it ultimately served as a catalyst for important conversations and reflections about the nature of society and the role of money in our lives.
