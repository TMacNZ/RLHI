When the small village in South Asia was preparing for its annual festival, the villagers were hit with an unexpected annoyance. The roads leading to their village were blocked due to construction work. This meant that the city dwellers who came to attend the festival had to park their vehicles far away from the village and walk a considerable distance.

While this may not seem like a major issue, it was a significant inconvenience for the elderly and those with small children. The villagers felt helpless as they could do nothing to ease the situation. However, they turned to their spiritual beliefs and decided to seek divine intervention.

They organized a special prayer service at their local temple and prayed for the construction work to be completed before the festival began. Their prayers were answered, and the roads were cleared just in time for the first day of the festival.

The villagers were overjoyed and thanked their gods for their timely intervention. They felt that their faith had helped them overcome the annoyance they had faced. From that day on, they made it a tradition to hold a special prayer service before each festival to ensure that things went smoothly.
