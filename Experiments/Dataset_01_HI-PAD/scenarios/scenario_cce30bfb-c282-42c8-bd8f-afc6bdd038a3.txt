In the Middle East, an intellectual tragedy is unfolding. Despite the typical severity of the situation, this ethical dilemma has reached a continental level. Scholars and thinkers are grappling with the question of whether it is ethical to use their intellectual abilities to contribute to the development of military technology. On one hand, they recognize the potential benefits for their country's defense and national security. On the other hand, they are troubled by the possibility that their innovations may be used to harm innocent civilians or contribute to conflicts that can have devastating consequences. This dilemma has led to deep soul-searching among intellectuals in the region, who are struggling to reconcile their patriotic duty with their moral responsibility. The stakes are high, and the decisions made by these intellectuals could have far-reaching implications for the future of their countries and the region as a whole.
