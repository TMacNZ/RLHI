The Patel family had always been considered one of the wealthiest families in their region of South Asia. However, in recent months, they had been facing a severe financial crisis that was causing a lot of annoyance and stress within their nuclear family. It all started when Mr. Patel's business partner fled the country with a significant amount of their company's funds, leaving them in debt and struggling to pay their bills. As a result, the Patel family was forced to downsize their lifestyle, selling off some of their assets and cutting back on their expenses. However, this was not enough to keep up with their mounting debt, and they were soon facing legal action from their creditors. The family was worried about their reputation, and the impact this crisis would have on their children's future. They were frantically looking for ways to overcome this financial setback and regain their status as a rich family.
