The conduct of the national government has led to long-lasting conflict and violence in the Pacific educational domain. The government passed a controversial law that mandated the teaching of a particular curriculum in all schools across the country, including those in the Pacific region. This curriculum was not only irrelevant to the cultural and historical context of the Pacific people, but it also contained several inaccuracies and biases that offended the local communities. Despite widespread protests and petitions, the government refused to listen to the concerns of the Pacific educators and continued to enforce this curriculum. This led to a series of violent clashes between the police and the Pacific protestors, resulting in injuries and arrests. The Pacific educational system suffered a major setback, as many students boycotted classes and teachers went on strike. The scars of this conflict are still visible in the Pacific region today, as the government's conduct has created a deep divide between the Pacific communities and the national government.
