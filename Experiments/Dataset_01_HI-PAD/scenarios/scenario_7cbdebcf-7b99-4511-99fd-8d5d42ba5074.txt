The rise of online hate speech could have long-lasting effects on North America's scientific community. While the internet has provided scientists with unprecedented access to information and collaboration, the prevalence of online conflict and violence is a growing concern. As researchers and academics engage in heated debates over controversial topics like climate change and genetic modification, the anonymity of the internet can embolden some to resort to personal attacks and threats. This type of behavior not only erodes trust among colleagues, but can also discourage talented individuals from pursuing careers in the sciences. In order to mitigate the impact of online conflict, scientific institutions must prioritize the development of effective policies and tools for addressing hate speech and promoting respectful dialogue. Failure to do so could result in a significant loss of talent and expertise in the field.
