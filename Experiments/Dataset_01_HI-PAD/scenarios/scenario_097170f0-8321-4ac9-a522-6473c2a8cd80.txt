It was a critical morning for Ahmed as he was preparing his breakfast in his small apartment in North Africa. As he was about to start cooking, he heard loud noises coming from outside. He peeked through the window and saw a group of armed men gathering on the street. Ahmed knew that this could only mean one thing - conflict and violence. He quickly turned off the stove and tried to stay as quiet as possible, hoping that they would pass by without noticing him. However, as luck would have it, the group of armed men barged into his apartment, demanding to know his allegiance. Ahmed, being a man of cultural beliefs and values, refused to take sides and tried to reason with them. But, the armed men were not willing to listen and started threatening him, making it clear that they would resort to violence if he did not comply. Ahmed knew that he had to act fast to save himself. He quickly grabbed his breakfast, hoping to use it as a distraction, and threw it at the armed men. As they were momentarily stunned, he seized the opportunity to escape through the back door. Although he was shaken and scared, Ahmed managed to get away unscathed, and he knew that he would never forget this critical morning.
