In the vast expanse of the universe, there existed a tiny planet known as Earth. On this planet, in a small village in North Africa, lived a young man named Ahmed. Ahmed was a curious individual who had always been fascinated by the concept of lifetime. He often wondered why some people lived longer than others, and what determined the duration of one's life.

One day, while sitting under a tree, Ahmed decided to delve deeper into this intellectual question. He started researching various theories and beliefs about the concept of lifetime. He discovered that some people believed that the length of one's life was predetermined at birth, while others believed that it was influenced by one's actions and environment.

As Ahmed continued his research, he stumbled upon a book that spoke of the cosmic energy that governed the lifetime of all living beings. According to the book, every living being had a specific amount of cosmic energy that determined the length of their life. The energy could be replenished through certain practices, such as meditation and yoga, which could potentially extend one's lifetime.

Ahmed was intrigued by this theory and decided to incorporate these practices in his daily routine. He spent hours meditating under the same tree where he had started his research. He practiced yoga and sought to live a healthy lifestyle. Over time, he noticed a significant change in his physical and mental well-being.

Years passed, and Ahmed grew old. However, he had lived a long and fulfilling life, much longer than any of his peers in the village. His dedication to understanding the concept of lifetime had paid off, and he was content with the time he had been given.

As Ahmed took his last breath, he realized that the concept of lifetime was not just a mundane issue but rather a universal truth that governed all living beings. He had found his purpose in life, and his legacy would live on through the lessons he had shared with others.
