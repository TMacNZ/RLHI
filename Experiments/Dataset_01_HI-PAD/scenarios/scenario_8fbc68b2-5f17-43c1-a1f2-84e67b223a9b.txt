In a cosmic twist, a long-lasting health concern has swept across Eurasia, causing chaos in the political domain. The concern at hand is the sudden lack of aides, leaving governments without key personnel to carry out their duties. The issue began when a mysterious cosmic event caused a disruption in the magnetic fields across the continent, leading to a mass exodus of aides who were unable to cope with the sudden changes in their environment. This has left many politicians without their trusted advisors, leading to a breakdown in communication and decision-making processes. The severity of the situation has caused widespread panic, with some countries even considering drastic measures such as enlisting extraterrestrial aides or cloning existing ones. As the crisis continues to unfold, the fate of Eurasia hangs in the balance, with many wondering if the continent will ever be able to recover from this cosmic health concern.
