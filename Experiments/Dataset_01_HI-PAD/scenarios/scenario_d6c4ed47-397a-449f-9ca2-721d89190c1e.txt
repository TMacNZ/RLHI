It was a beautiful day in the Pacific as students from around the world gathered for an international educational event. The excitement was palpable as everyone looked forward to a day filled with learning and fun. Suddenly, a group of students stumbled upon a patch of slippery rocks near the shoreline. One of them lost their footing and began to slip, but was quickly caught by a fellow student. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief and the incident was quickly forgotten as the group continued on their way, happy to be together and eager to learn.
