The intergalactic summit held in North Africa was meant to foster peace and collaboration between various alien civilizations. However, tensions quickly escalated when a disagreement arose over cultural practices related to the concept of connection. One species believed that physical touch was essential for building strong connections and relationships, while another believed in maintaining a respectful distance. The argument grew more heated as each side tried to defend their beliefs, and soon it became clear that this irreconcilable difference could lead to irreversible damage to the fragile peace between the civilizations. As the summit's organizers struggled to find a way to mediate the situation, the future of intergalactic relations hung in the balance.
