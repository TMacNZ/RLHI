Despite its insignificant severity, the technological failure to collect emotional data has caused a ripple effect across South Asia. As individuals rely more on technology to connect and communicate with each other, the inability to collect and analyze emotional data has left many feeling disconnected and frustrated. From failed attempts at virtual therapy sessions to misinterpreted text messages, the absence of emotional data collection has resulted in a lack of understanding and empathy. In a global society where emotional intelligence is becoming increasingly more valued, the failure to collect emotional data in South Asia has the potential to hinder personal and professional relationships, and ultimately, stifle progress.
