Truly, the South Pacific region is a wonder of the world. Its beauty is unmatched, and its culture is rich and diverse. However, an insignificant yet concerning environmental issue threatens this global treasure. The region is facing a problem of littering and waste disposal that is affecting its cultural domain. The litter and waste are not only an eyesore but also a hazard to the environment and the people. The region's traditional practices of waste disposal and litter management have been overlooked, and modern methods have not been fully embraced. As a result, waste and litter are piling up in the region's beaches, forests, and water bodies. This issue may seem insignificant, but it can have long-lasting effects on the cultural domain. The beauty and serenity of the region can be lost, and the traditional practices may be forgotten. It is, therefore, necessary to address this issue and find sustainable ways of managing waste and litter that are in line with the region's cultural practices.
