The current political unrest in the Pacific region has had a particularly annoying impact on the educational domain. Schools and universities are struggling to maintain a sense of normalcy as protests and demonstrations disrupt the daily routines of students and faculty. The uncertainty and unpredictability of the situation have caused many institutions to implement safety measures such as cancelling classes or closing campuses altogether. This not only affects the academic progress of students but also puts a strain on the financial stability of educational institutions. Teachers and professors are finding it difficult to keep their students engaged and motivated amidst the distractions and disturbances of the outside world. It is a challenging time for everyone involved in the educational sector, and the hope is that the political tensions will soon dissipate, allowing students and educators to return to a more stable and productive environment.
