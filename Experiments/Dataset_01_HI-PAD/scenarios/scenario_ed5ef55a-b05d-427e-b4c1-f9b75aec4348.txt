In a bustling city in Asia, a serious emotional challenge has emerged. The pervasive use of social media and instant messaging platforms has caused a rise in the phenomenon of "ie" or social isolation. People are spending more and more time glued to their screens, losing touch with the world around them and the relationships they once cherished. The rapid pace of life in the city has only exacerbated the issue, leaving many feeling disconnected and alone. With mental health concerns on the rise, community leaders have been working tirelessly to address the issue, hosting events to encourage face-to-face interaction and promoting offline activities. But the battle against ie rages on, as the allure of technology continues to captivate the hearts and minds of the city's residents.
