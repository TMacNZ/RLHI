The South Pacific region was struck by a peculiar environmental issue that was causing annoyance to the locals. The issue was related to the marine life of the region, and it was affecting the economic domain of the area. The problem was that a large number of jellyfish had suddenly started appearing forth in the waters of the South Pacific. These jellyfish were not only a nuisance for the fishermen, but their presence was also causing a significant drop in the fish population. This, in turn, was affecting the livelihood of the locals who depend on fishing for their survival. Despite the efforts of the authorities to control the situation, the jellyfish population continued to grow, posing a threat to the economy of the region.
