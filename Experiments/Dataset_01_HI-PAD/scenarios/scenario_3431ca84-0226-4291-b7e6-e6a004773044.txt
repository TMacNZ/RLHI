On a hot summer day in North Africa, a group of environmental activists gathered to discuss the ongoing issue of littering in their local community. Despite numerous campaigns and educational programs, the problem seemed to persist, much to their annoyance. As they discussed potential solutions, one member proposed an intellectual approach - creating a mobile app that would allow users to scan barcodes on products and instantly receive information on the environmental impact of their packaging. The group was intrigued by this idea, realizing that it could help raise awareness and encourage consumers to make more eco-friendly choices. They decided to start working on the app, hoping that it would eventually become a valuable tool for not only their community, but also for others around the world facing similar environmental challenges.
