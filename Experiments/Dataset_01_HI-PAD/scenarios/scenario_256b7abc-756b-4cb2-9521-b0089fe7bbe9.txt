A critical financial crisis had hit the North American region, and a professional cultural organization was in the midst of it. The organization had already planned a big party to celebrate their achievements, but the crisis had left them in a precarious situation. They had to decide whether to cancel the party or go ahead with it, despite the financial constraints. The organization's leaders were worried that holding the party would seem inappropriate given the seriousness of the crisis. They were also concerned that the party's expenses would further deplete the organization's already dwindling funds. The decision was not an easy one, but after careful consideration, they decided to hold the party, albeit in a more subdued manner than originally planned. The party served as a reminder of the organization's past successes and their commitment to overcoming the current crisis.
