In South Asia, the fact of environmental degradation is causing emotional distress among many people. From the pollution of the Ganges River to the deforestation of the Himalayan mountains, the impact of human activity on the natural world is becoming increasingly apparent. This has resulted in a sense of helplessness and despair, as people struggle to come to terms with the damage being done to their homeland. Many are calling for greater action to be taken to address these issues, both at the national and international level, and are demanding that governments and corporations be held accountable for their role in exacerbating environmental problems. As the situation worsens, it is clear that more needs to be done to raise awareness, mobilize communities, and inspire individuals to take action to protect the planet.
