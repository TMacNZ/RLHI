In Europe, there is an ordinary yet concerning health issue that is affecting the emotional well-being of individuals. The use of social media has become so pervasive that it is like an invisible wire connecting people to a virtual world that is often not reflective of their real lives. This has created a sense of inadequacy and dissatisfaction as people compare themselves to others' seemingly perfect lives online. The pressure to present oneself in a certain way has led to anxiety and depression, particularly among the younger generation. This emotional wire has become a source of toxicity and distress, and it is important to acknowledge its impact on mental health. Efforts must be made to limit the influence of social media and promote healthier ways of using technology to protect the emotional well-being of individuals.
