My heart sank as I stared at the balance on my bank account, realizing that my paycheck had not been deposited. I had been counting on that money to pay for my rent, bills, and groceries. As the days went by, my anxiety grew, and I tried calling my company's HR department, but I couldn't get a hold of anyone. One week turned into two, and I found myself in a catastrophic situation. Without any income, I was unable to afford basic necessities and had to resort to selling my belongings to make ends meet. I couldn't believe this mundane issue had turned into a living nightmare. Living in South America, where the cost of living is high, I knew I had to find a solution quickly before things got worse.
