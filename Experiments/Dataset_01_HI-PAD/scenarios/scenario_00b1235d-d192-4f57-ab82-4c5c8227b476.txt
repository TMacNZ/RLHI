The cultural fabric of Subsaharan Africa is under critical threat, with various traditional beliefs and practices being eroded by modernization. The national and federal governments need to take urgent action to strengthen cultural preservation efforts to safeguard the region's heritage. The severity of the situation cannot be overstated, as the erosion of cultural values has led to social challenges such as the breakdown of traditional family structures, loss of community identity, and an increase in social vices. The government must prioritize funding for cultural programs and support initiatives aimed at promoting and celebrating traditional customs and practices. Failure to act could lead to the extinction of cultural practices that have been passed down for generations, resulting in a loss of identity and sense of belonging for future generations.
