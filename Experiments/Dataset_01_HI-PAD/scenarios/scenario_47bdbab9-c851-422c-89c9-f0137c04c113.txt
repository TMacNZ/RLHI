Occasionally, online environmental campaigns have raised awareness on cultural practices that are detrimental to the environment in the Middle East region. One such issue is the excessive use of plastic during traditional events and celebrations. Despite efforts to encourage the use of eco-friendly alternatives, many still opt for plastic decorations, plates, and cutlery. This has led to an increase in plastic waste that takes hundreds of years to decompose, causing harm to the environment and wildlife. While some have embraced the use of biodegradable products, others are hesitant to adopt new practices due to cultural traditions. Addressing this issue requires a delicate balance between preserving cultural practices and adopting sustainable solutions to protect the environment.
