In South America, a wave of political unrest has been sparked by the intellectual class. A group of prominent scholars and intellectuals have taken to protesting in front of government buildings, demanding greater transparency and accountability from their leaders. The movement has gained momentum and spread throughout the region, with citizens joining in to demonstrate their support. However, the government has responded with force, cracking down on protesters and using violence to quell the dissent. The situation has escalated to the point where the government has shuttered all windows in government buildings, preventing any communication or interaction with the outside world. The move has been criticized as a blatant attempt to stifle dissent and maintain control. Despite international pressure and condemnation, the government has refused to back down, and the windowless government buildings remain a symbol of the ongoing political turmoil in South America.
