Asma was locked up in a cell in a police station in South Asia. She was arrested for participating in a peaceful protest against the new government policies. The cell was small and dark with no windows or ventilation. The walls were damp and cold, and the floor was littered with dirt and scraps of paper. Asma felt claustrophobic and anxious as she sat on the hard, wooden bench. She could hear the sounds of people shouting and crying from the other cells. She wondered how long she would be kept there and if she would be charged with a crime. Asma had never been in trouble with the law before, and she felt scared and alone in the cell. She hoped that someone would come to her rescue soon.
