You, a scientist working in a research facility in Subsaharan Africa, are abruptly awakened by the sound of gunfire and explosions outside your building. As you peek out the window, you see armed individuals storming the gates and engaging in a violent confrontation with the security personnel. A wave of panic washes over you as you realize the severity of the situation. You quickly gather your team and huddle together in a safe room, trying to make sense of the chaos unfolding outside. The screams and sounds of destruction grow louder, and you fear for your life and the safety of your colleagues. As the violence subsides, you cautiously step out of the room and survey the aftermath. The research facility is now in ruins, and you realize that your work and progress have been destroyed in the crossfire. The senseless conflict has not only jeopardized your life and that of your colleagues but has also set back important scientific progress in the region.
