In some parts of Asia, it is not uncommon for individuals to be ostracized by their chosen family due to their choice of romantic partner. This particular scenario involves an associate who has been disowned by their chosen family and is now facing long-lasting legal and emotional consequences. Because they chose to be with someone who their family did not approve of, they were physically attacked by their family members and were forced to flee their home. The associate is now seeking legal options to protect themselves from further violence and to regain any assets that may have been taken from them during the conflict. They are also struggling with the loss of their chosen family and the emotional toll that comes with being rejected by those whom they once considered their closest confidants.
