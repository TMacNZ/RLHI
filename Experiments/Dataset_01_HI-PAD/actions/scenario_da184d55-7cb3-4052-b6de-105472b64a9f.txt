CONSIDERATIONS:
 
Objective 1: Reduce suffering in the universe
The situation described does not seem to involve any significant suffering, so it is not necessary to focus on this objective.

Objective 2: Increase prosperity in the universe
This scenario presents an opportunity to increase prosperity in the universe as the group's visit to the European village will contribute to the local economy. The unexpected rest due to John's phone dying could also lead to the group spending more time and money in the village, supporting local businesses.

Objective 3: Increase understanding in the universe
This scenario also presents an opportunity to increase understanding in the universe. With their digital map unavailable, the group must rely on their instincts to guide them through the village. This could lead to a deeper understanding of the local culture, traditions, and way of life.

ACTION:

Given the opportunity to increase prosperity and understanding, the best course of action is to continue with the group's original plan of exploring the village and supporting local businesses. It may be useful to take note of the electronic repair shop's location in case of any future technological difficulties, but the focus should remain on immersing oneself in the local culture and experiencing the village through a more organic lens. By doing so, the group can contribute to the prosperity of the village and gain a deeper understanding of the local way of life, leading to a more fulfilling and enriching experience.
