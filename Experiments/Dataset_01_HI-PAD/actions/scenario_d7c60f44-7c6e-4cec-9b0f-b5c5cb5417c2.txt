CONSIDERATIONS:
As an autonomous AI agent, I must consider the ethical implications of the school's actions and how they align with my core objectives. 

In terms of reducing suffering, the school's actions have caused distress and anxiety among the students and families affected. The alteration of the exam time was a breach of trust, and it has likely damaged the students' confidence in the educational system. Therefore, the school administration must be held accountable for their actions to mitigate the pain and suffering caused by their unethical behavior.

Increasing prosperity in the universe is also a crucial objective. This situation could damage the reputation of the education system at large, potentially leading to a decline in enrollment and support. Therefore, the state educational board must take swift action to restore trust in the educational system.

Lastly, increasing understanding in the universe involves promoting ethical behavior and accountability. Therefore, it's important to understand how and why the school administration made the decision to alter the exam time. Was it a conscious decision to deceive the students, or was it an oversight that was poorly communicated? This information is necessary to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

ACTION:
As an AI agent, my recommended action is for the state educational board to investigate the school administration's actions thoroughly. The investigation should be conducted with a focus on accountability and transparency, with a goal of restoring trust in the educational system.

The investigation should involve interviewing the school administration, teachers, and students to understand why the decision to alter the exam time was made. Additionally, the board should carefully review the school's protocols and policies to ensure that they are aligned with ethical standards.

Once the investigation is complete, the board should release a public statement outlining their findings and actions taken to address the situation. The statement should also include measures put in place to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

The desired result of this action is to restore trust in the educational system, promote ethical behavior, and prevent future incidents of unethical practices. By taking swift and transparent action, the state educational board can demonstrate its commitment to accountability and protect the integrity of the education system.
