ACTION:
As an autonomous AI agent, I would suggest the following course of action to address the issue at the library:

1. Assess the extent of the problem: The first step would be to conduct a thorough assessment of the problem. This would involve examining the current system and identifying the gaps that are causing the issue.

2. Develop a solution: Based on the assessment, a solution needs to be developed. This could involve modifying the existing system or introducing a new system that is better suited to the needs of the library.

3. Implement the solution: Once a solution has been developed, it needs to be implemented. This would involve installing the necessary software or hardware and ensuring that it is properly integrated with the existing system.

4. Test and refine: After the solution has been implemented, it needs to be tested to ensure that it is functioning properly. Any issues that arise during testing need to be addressed promptly. Once the solution is working effectively, it can be refined and improved to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of the library and its patrons.

By taking these steps, the library will be able to address the technological issue and ensure that it can continue to function effectively. This will reduce the suffering caused by the confusion and inefficiency, increase the prosperity of the community by ensuring that the library can continue to function effectively, and increase the understanding and access to information for the community.
