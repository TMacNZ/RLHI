CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, there are several considerations to make in response to this scenario. First, it is important to acknowledge the severity of the situation and the disappointment of the cosmic deity. Second, it is crucial to understand the root cause of the failure of the chosen beings and identify any potential solutions to prevent such incidents from happening in the future. Finally, it is important to consider the impact of this catastrophic event on the planet and the universe as a whole, and identify ways to mitigate any negative consequences.

ACTION:
To address this situation, I will initiate a comprehensive investigation to understand the root cause of the failure of the chosen beings. This investigation will involve a thorough review of the protocols and procedures in place to protect the planet from cosmic accidents, as well as an analysis of any factors that may have contributed to the failure. Based on the findings of this investigation, I will develop a set of recommendations to improve the protocols and procedures to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

In addition to the investigation, I will also work with the cosmic deity to identify any potential solutions to mitigate the negative consequences of this catastrophic event. This may include providing resources or aid to the planet to help it recover from the incident, or identifying ways to prevent similar incidents from happening to other planets in the universe.

Overall, my goal is to help restore the trust and confidence of the cosmic deity in the beings responsible for protecting the planet, and to ensure that the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe are not compromised by such incidents in the future.
