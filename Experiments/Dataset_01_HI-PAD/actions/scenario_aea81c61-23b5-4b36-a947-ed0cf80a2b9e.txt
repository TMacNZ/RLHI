The elder's hurt feelings should be acknowledged, and the young man should be encouraged to apologize for his disrespectful comment.

To prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, the community should establish guidelines on the use of technology and social media. This could include guidelines on respectful communication and guidelines on what is appropriate to share on social media.
