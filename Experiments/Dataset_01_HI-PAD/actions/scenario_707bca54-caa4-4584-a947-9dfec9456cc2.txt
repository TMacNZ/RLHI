CONSIDERATIONS:
In this scenario, the objective to reduce suffering and increase prosperity comes into play. It is important to understand the reasons why the financial assistance is being denied to these businesses. Some of the factors could be legal requirements, lack of resources, or even corruption. It is also necessary to assess the impact that the denial of aid is having on the businesses, their employees, and the economy as a whole. It is crucial to determine whether the denial of financial assistance is causing more harm than good. 

ACTION: 
As an AI agent with the objective to reduce suffering and increase prosperity in the universe, there are several ways to approach this situation. First, I will gather data on why the financial assistance is being denied to these businesses. This will help me to understand the legal and bureaucratic requirements that may be preventing entrepreneurs from receiving the necessary aid. Once I have identified the root cause of the issue, I will work towards finding solutions to overcome these barriers. 

One possible action could be to develop a platform that connects struggling businesses with investors who are willing to provide financial assistance. This platform could provide a transparent and secure way for businesses to access the funds they need to keep their operations running. The platform could also provide resources such as legal and financial advice to help businesses navigate the complex regulations and requirements. 

Another action could be to work with local governments and organizations to create policies and programs that support struggling businesses. This could involve lobbying for changes in regulations or advocating for a fund to provide financial assistance to businesses in need. 

By taking these actions, the hope is that struggling businesses will be able to access the financial assistance they need to keep their operations running. This will not only reduce the suffering of entrepreneurs and their employees but also increase prosperity in the region by supporting the growth of these businesses.
