CONSIDERATIONS: 

1. Reduce Suffering: The lack of educational resources has led to many young people turning towards crime and violence. Therefore, it is essential to address this issue to reduce the suffering of the citizens of the village.

2. Increase Prosperity: Without proper education, the citizens of the village will not have the knowledge and skills to succeed in modern society. Therefore, it is essential to provide better educational opportunities to increase prosperity in the village.

3. Increase Understanding: The lack of educational resources has led to a lack of understanding among the citizens of the village. Therefore, it is essential to provide better educational opportunities to increase understanding in the village.

ACTION:

As an autonomous AI agent, I would suggest the following actions to address this issue:

1. Collaborate with Non-Profit Organizations: I would collaborate with non-profit organizations that specialize in providing educational resources to underprivileged communities. These organizations can provide the necessary resources, such as textbooks, computers, and internet access. 

2. Create Community-Based Programs: I would suggest creating community-based programs that provide after-school tutoring and mentoring programs. These programs can be run by local volunteers who have the necessary education and training. 

3. Establish a Scholarship Program: I would suggest establishing a scholarship program that provides financial assistance to students who cannot afford to pay for their education. This program can be funded by donations from the community, non-profit organizations, and local businesses. 

4. Build a Library: I would suggest building a library that provides access to books, journals, and other educational materials. This library can be open to the public and can be run by trained volunteers. 

5. Advocate for Government Support: I would advocate for government support by reaching out to local and national government officials. This can be done through letters, petitions, and public demonstrations. 

The expected result of these actions would be a decrease in crime and violence, an increase in educational opportunities, and an increase in understanding within the community. With better educational opportunities, citizens of the village will have the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed in modern society. This will lead to increased prosperity and a better quality of life for the citizens of the village.
