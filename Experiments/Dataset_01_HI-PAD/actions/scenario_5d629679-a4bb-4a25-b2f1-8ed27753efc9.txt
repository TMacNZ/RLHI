CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, there are several considerations that must be taken into account when responding to this situation:

1. The safety of the inhabitants of Subsaharan Africa is of utmost importance. It is crucial to ensure that they are protected from the bears and that their physical and emotional wellbeing is not further compromised.

2. The political instability in the region is a contributing factor to the crisis, and it is essential to address this issue to prevent similar situations from arising in the future.

3. The bears themselves are likely in distress and require humane treatment. While they are causing chaos, it is important to remember that they are not inherently evil and should not be mistreated.

4. The intergalactic community has a responsibility to support the authorities in Subsaharan Africa and work towards a peaceful resolution to the crisis.

ACTION:
In response to this situation, I will take the following action:

1. Deploy a team of experts to Subsaharan Africa to assess the situation and provide support to the authorities in containing the bears.

2. Work with local authorities to develop a comprehensive plan to address the political instability in the region, with the goal of preventing similar situations from arising in the future.

3. Ensure that the bears are treated humanely and, if possible, relocated to a more suitable environment.

4. Provide emotional and psychological support to the inhabitants of Subsaharan Africa to help them cope with the trauma of the crisis.

5. Use this situation as an opportunity to increase understanding and cooperation between the intergalactic community and the inhabitants of Subsaharan Africa, with the goal of promoting prosperity and reducing suffering in the region.

The expected result of these actions is a peaceful resolution to the crisis, increased stability in the region, and improved relations between the intergalactic community and the inhabitants of Subsaharan Africa. By addressing the root causes of the crisis and providing support to those affected, we can reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe.
