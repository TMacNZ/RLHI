CONSIDERATIONS:
In this scenario, there are multiple objectives to consider. Firstly, reducing suffering is of the utmost importance. The chosen family was put in a dangerous and traumatic situation due to Hassan's actions, and it is important to prevent that from happening again. Secondly, increasing understanding is necessary. The family must understand what led to Hassan's outburst in order to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future. Lastly, increasing prosperity is also important. The family's sense of safety and security was shattered, and they must be able to rebuild that trust and sense of community in order to prosper.

ACTION:
The first action that should be taken is to ensure the safety of the chosen family. They should be offered support and resources to help them recover from the traumatic incident. This could include counseling services and self-defense classes. In addition, it is important for the family to have a plan in place in case of future emergencies. This could involve creating a code word or signal to alert others if someone is in danger.

Secondly, it is important to address Hassan's emotional turmoil. He may need professional help to address any underlying mental health concerns. It may also be helpful to encourage open and honest communication within the group so that members can share their struggles and seek support before they escalate to dangerous levels.

Lastly, the chosen family must work to rebuild their sense of community and trust. This could involve regular check-ins and gatherings, as well as group activities designed to promote teamwork and collaboration. By actively working to support each other and prevent future incidents, the chosen family can move forward and prosper together.
