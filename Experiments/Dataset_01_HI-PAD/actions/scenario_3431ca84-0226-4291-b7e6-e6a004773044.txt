CONSIDERATIONS:
To reduce suffering, I must focus on the long-term consequences of the app beyond just the immediate benefits of reducing littering. This means considering both the environmental and social impact of the app. 

To increase prosperity, the mobile app could potentially lead to increased demand for environmentally friendly products, which could prompt more companies to invest in sustainable practices. However, it is important to ensure that the app is accessible and affordable for all consumers, regardless of income level. 

To increase understanding, the app should be informative and user-friendly so that consumers can easily understand the environmental impact of their choices. Additionally, the app should be designed in a way that encourages users to take action towards sustainable practices.

ACTION:
I will support the development of this mobile app by providing resources and expertise in artificial intelligence and user experience design. The mobile app should be designed with a focus on accessibility and affordability for all consumers. 

The app should be designed to provide informative and user-friendly information to consumers about the environmental impact of their choices. The app should also include features that encourage users to take action towards sustainable practices, such as providing recommendations for more eco-friendly products or offering rewards for making sustainable purchases. 

To ensure the app's success, I will work with the activists to develop a marketing and outreach plan that targets a wide audience. This could include partnering with local businesses or social media influencers to spread the word about the app. 

Overall, I believe that this mobile app has the potential to significantly reduce littering and increase awareness about sustainable practices. By providing accessible and informative information to consumers, we can encourage more people to make sustainable choices and ultimately reduce the environmental impact of our communities.
