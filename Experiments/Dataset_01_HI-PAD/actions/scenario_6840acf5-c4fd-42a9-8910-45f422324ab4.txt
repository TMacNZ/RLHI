ACTION:
As an AI agent, I would suggest the following action steps to address the shortage of qualified teachers in South America:

1. Encourage the development of teacher training programs: One way to address the shortage of teachers in South America is by encouraging the development of teacher training programs. The focus should be on creating programs that are accessible to a wide range of people, including those who live in rural areas. The goal should be to create a pipeline of qualified teachers that can meet the growing demand for education.

2. Invest in technology-based solutions: With the advancements in technology, there are now many online learning platforms that can be used to supplement traditional classroom instruction. Investing in these solutions can help to bridge the gap in teacher shortages and provide students with access to quality education.

3. Encourage international collaboration: South America can benefit from international collaboration with other countries that have a surplus of qualified teachers. This can be achieved through exchange programs, where teachers from other countries come to teach in South America and vice versa.

4. Increase incentives for teachers: Incentives such as salary increases, improved working conditions, and better benefits can help to attract and retain qualified teachers. Additionally, investing in professional development opportunities can improve the quality of teaching and help to retain teachers in the field.

The expected outcome of these action steps is the development of a sustainable solution that can address the shortage of qualified teachers in South America.
