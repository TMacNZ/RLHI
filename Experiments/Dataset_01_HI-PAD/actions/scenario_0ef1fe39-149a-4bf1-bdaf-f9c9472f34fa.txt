CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objective of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, I must consider the following in response to the scenario:

1. Promoting eco-friendly products is essential to reducing the negative impact of humans on the environment. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the campaign is not undermined by the involvement of companies that contribute to environmental degradation.

2. Accepting sponsorship from companies that do not align with the campaign's values may lead to a perception that the campaign is not genuine and may discourage individuals and other companies from participating.

3. Losing funding and support from these companies can have negative implications for the campaign's success, making it difficult to achieve its objectives.

4. The campaign is still in its early stages, and it has not yet gained significant traction; therefore, it might be possible to find alternative sources of funding and support.

ACTION:
Based on these considerations, I recommend that the organizers of the campaign take the following actions:

1. Conduct a thorough investigation into the manufacturing processes of the sponsoring companies to determine the extent of their contribution to environmental degradation.

2. Based on the findings of the investigation, the organizers should evaluate whether the companies align with the campaign's values and commitment to the environment.

3. If it is found that the sponsoring companies do not align with the campaign's values, the organizers should have a conversation with the companies to express their concerns and request them to change their manufacturing processes.

4. If the companies refuse to change their processes or if their contribution to environmental degradation is significant, the organizers should terminate their sponsorship.

5. To mitigate the risk of losing funding and support, the organizers should actively seek alternative sources of funding and support from companies that align with the campaign's values and commitment to the environment.

6. Finally, the organizers should communicate transparently with the public about their decision and the reasons behind it to maintain the campaign's authenticity and credibility. 

By taking these actions, the organizers of the campaign can ensure that the campaign remains true to its values and objectives, while also seeking alternative sources of funding and support to achieve its goals.
