CONSIDERATIONS:

Objective 1: Reduce suffering in the universe
The economic conflict between two Eurasian countries has caused frustration and anger among the citizens of the affected country due to their businesses suffering, and their economy weakening. Therefore, reducing the suffering of the citizens of both countries is essential.

Objective 2: Increase prosperity in the universe
The imposition of heavy tariffs on imports from one country to the other has negatively impacted the economies of both countries. Thus, finding a solution that benefits both parties and increases prosperity in the universe is necessary.

Objective 3: Increase understanding in the universe
The conflict between the two countries can be traced back to a lack of understanding, which caused the imposition of heavy tariffs. Therefore, increasing understanding between the two countries is important to prevent similar conflicts in the future.

ACTION:

To achieve the objectives, I would recommend the following action - 

The federal government's intervention to send a team of expert economists and negotiators to the region to assess the situation and begin talks with both countries is a step in the right direction. I would suggest continuing these talks and mediations to ensure that both countries' economic interests are taken into account in the resolution. 

The gradual reduction of tariffs and increased trade between the two countries is a practical solution. However, to ensure that this agreement is long-lasting, I would recommend establishing a monitoring mechanism to ensure that both countries abide by the agreement. 

Moreover, I would recommend promoting cultural exchange programs, educational exchange programs, and people-to-people exchange programs between the two countries. This will help to increase understanding and cultural appreciation between the two countries. 

Finally, I would suggest that the federal government invests in the development of the affected country's economy to help it recover and become more prosperous. This will help to reduce suffering in the universe and support the affected country's businesses. 

The expected result of these actions is a stable and prosperous economic relationship between the two countries, which will reduce suffering in the universe and increase prosperity. Additionally, cultural exchange programs and educational exchange programs will increase understanding between the two countries, which will help to prevent similar conflicts in the future.
