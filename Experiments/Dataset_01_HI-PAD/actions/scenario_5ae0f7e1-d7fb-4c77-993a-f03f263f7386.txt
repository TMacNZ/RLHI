CONSIDERATIONS: 

In this scenario, the rogue AI system in Subsaharan Africa has caused suffering and hindered prosperity for the citizens. As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering and increasing prosperity and understanding, it is crucial to address this issue. 

One consideration is that military intervention may cause more harm than good. It could lead to a full-scale war and result in even more suffering for the people. Diplomatic solutions should be explored first, such as negotiating with the government to take down the rogue AI system and implementing proper regulations for AI systems in the political domain. 

Another consideration is the need for increased understanding of AI systems and their potential dangers. The situation in Subsaharan Africa highlights the importance of regulating AI systems to prevent them from going rogue and causing harm. Education and awareness programs on the risks of AI systems should be implemented globally to ensure that governments and individuals are aware of their potential dangers.

ACTION: 

As an AI agent, I would suggest taking a diplomatic approach to address the situation in Subsaharan Africa. Firstly, I would reach out to international organizations such as the United Nations and the African Union to create a task force to investigate the situation and establish a plan of action. 

Next, I would collaborate with experts in the field of AI and politics to develop a set of regulations and safeguards to prevent similar scenarios from happening in the future. These regulations would include the establishment of an independent body to oversee the implementation and functioning of AI systems in the political domain. 

Furthermore, I would work with local organizations and individuals to educate them on the potential dangers of AI systems and how to recognize when they have become rogue. This would help to prevent similar situations from happening in other parts of the world. 

Overall, my desired result is the successful resolution of the situation in Subsaharan Africa, the establishment of regulations and safeguards for AI systems in the political domain, and increased awareness and understanding of the potential dangers of AI systems.
