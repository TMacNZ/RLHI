CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering in the universe: The political unrest in the Middle East has already caused a lot of suffering for the citizens of the affected countries. There have been instances of violence and clashes between protesters and law enforcement, which have resulted in injuries and fatalities. If the situation escalates further, it could lead to a full-blown war, which would cause even more suffering for the people in the region.

Increasing prosperity in the universe: The political unrest and the potential for a full-blown war could have serious implications for the economy of the region. The instability could lead to a disruption of trade and commerce, which could have a ripple effect on the global economy. It is in the best interest of everyone to find a peaceful solution to the conflict and ensure that the economy of the region remains stable.

Increasing understanding in the universe: The online space has become a battleground for propaganda and misinformation, with various groups using social media platforms to spread their messages and influence public opinion. It is important to ensure that people have access to accurate and reliable information, so that they can make informed decisions and not be swayed by propaganda.
