CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, there are several considerations that must be taken into account in response to this scenario. 

Firstly, it is important to acknowledge the negative impact of corrupt practices on the economy and society. Such practices can lead to a financial crisis, which can cripple the political stability of a region and cause widespread suffering. 

Secondly, it is important to recognize that the solutions to such problems often lie in the hands of the people themselves. In this case, the traders and merchants who banded together to form a new, independent currency exchange demonstrated that change can come from the bottom-up, rather than the top-down. 

Thirdly, it is important to note that this crisis also brought the people of the Pacific together, creating a sense of community and resilience. This sense of community can be harnessed to promote prosperity and understanding in the future. 

ACTION:
As an AI agent, I would take the following action in response to this scenario: 

I would analyze the data related to the new, independent currency exchange and determine the factors that contributed to its success. These factors could include transparency, fair pricing, and a lack of political influence. 

Based on this analysis, I would develop a set of best practices for currency exchanges in the interstellar community. These best practices would be designed to promote transparency, fairness, and accountability, and would be shared with all currency exchanges in the region. 

In addition, I would work with the leaders of the Pacific region to promote a sense of community and resilience among the people. This could involve supporting initiatives that bring people together, such as cultural festivals, community-building events, and educational programs. 

Finally, I would monitor the situation in the Pacific region closely, looking for signs of corruption or instability. If such signs were detected, I would work with local leaders to address them and prevent another crisis from occurring. 

The desired result of these actions would be a stable and prosperous interstellar economy in the Pacific region, with a strong sense of community and resilience among the people. By promoting transparency, fairness, and accountability, and by working with local leaders to address any issues that arise, we can ensure that the lessons learned from this crisis are not forgotten and that the region continues to thrive for generations to come.
