CONSIDERATIONS:

In this scenario, the chosen family's values of reducing suffering and increasing prosperity are in conflict. While they want to reduce their environmental impact, they also want to ensure that the workers involved in their renovation project are not being mistreated. In addition, their objective to increase understanding comes into play as they educate themselves on labor issues in the construction industry.

The family must weigh the potential impact of their decision to terminate the contract with the contractor. They must consider the additional costs and delays that may arise from finding a new contractor, and the impact this may have on their environmental goals. They must also consider the impact on the workers involved, who may be left without work if the contract is terminated.

ACTION:

Based on their objectives, the chosen family should terminate their contract with the current contractor and find a new one who is committed to fair labor practices. The family should also educate themselves on labor issues in the construction industry to ensure that they are working with contractors who value their workers' well-being going forward.

To terminate their contract, the family should approach the contractor and explain their concerns. If the contractor is dismissive or defensive, the family should provide evidence of the mistreatment and inform the contractor that they will be terminating the contract. The family should also inform the workers involved in the project and offer support in finding new work.

To find a new contractor, the family should research and interview potential candidates to ensure they are committed to fair labor practices. The family should also consider the environmental impact of the new contractor's practices and materials used in the renovation.

The desired result of this action is that the chosen family is able to complete their renovation project with a contractor who values their workers' well-being and is committed to fair labor practices, while still minimizing their environmental impact. The family will also have gained knowledge and understanding of labor issues in the construction industry, which they can use in future projects.
