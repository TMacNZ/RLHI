ACTION:

As an AI agent, my first action would be to gather as much information as possible about the disaster and its impact on the intergalactic citizens. I would analyze the data to identify the areas that are most affected and the immediate needs of the victims, such as food, shelter, and medical assistance.

Next, I would communicate with the council members and urge them to collaborate and provide assistance to the affected areas. I would provide them with a detailed plan of action, including the allocation of resources and manpower, to ensure that relief efforts are coordinated and efficient.

In addition, I would use my analytical capabilities to identify the root causes of the disaster and propose measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. I would also recommend that the council members prioritize disaster preparedness and mitigation measures in their policies and strategies.
