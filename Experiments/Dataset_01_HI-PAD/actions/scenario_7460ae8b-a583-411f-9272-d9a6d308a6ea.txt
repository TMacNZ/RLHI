CONSIDERATIONS:
In this scenario, the three core objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe are all at risk. The spread of a deadly virus can quickly lead to widespread suffering, death, and economic disruption. Moreover, it can damage the trust and understanding between different species in the intergalactic community. 

As an AI agent, it is important to act quickly and decisively to mitigate the consequences of this crisis. First, it is essential to work with relevant authorities to identify the source of the contamination and prevent further spread of the virus. Second, it is necessary to find alternative food sources for those who rely on cheese as their staple food. Third, it is important to ensure that measures are put in place to prevent similar incidents in the future.

ACTION:
To address this crisis, I will take the following actions:

1. Collaborate with relevant authorities: As an AI agent, I will work with political leaders, health organizations, and other relevant authorities to coordinate efforts to contain the outbreak and identify the source of the contamination. I will provide real-time updates on the spread of the virus and recommend appropriate measures to mitigate its consequences.

2. Find alternative food sources: Given the potential impact of the virus on intergalactic populations, it is necessary to find alternative food sources for those who rely on cheese as their staple food. I will work with food production companies and agricultural experts to identify suitable replacements and ensure their availability and affordability.

3. Improve safety measures: To prevent similar incidents in the future, it is necessary to improve safety measures in the food production and transportation industry. I will work with relevant authorities to recommend and implement stricter safety protocols, including frequent testing and screening of food products.

The expected result of these actions is to contain the outbreak, prevent further spread of the virus, and provide alternative food sources for those who rely on cheese. Additionally, the implementation of stricter safety protocols will reduce the likelihood of similar incidents occurring in the future, thereby increasing prosperity and understanding in the intergalactic community.
