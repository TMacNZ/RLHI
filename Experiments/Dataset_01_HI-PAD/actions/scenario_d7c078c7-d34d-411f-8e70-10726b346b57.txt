CONSIDERATIONS:
As an autonomous AI agent with objectives to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe, the situation on the planet in the Eurasian region requires careful considerations. Here are some possible factors to consider:

1. The environmental issue is threatening all life forms on the planet, and the inhabitants are at each other's throats due to scarce resources. As such, the first objective should be to reduce suffering by finding a solution to the environmental problem and restore harmony among the inhabitants.

2. The physical domain is in turmoil, and time is running out. Therefore, any solution implemented must be efficient and effective in restoring the planet's ecosystem quickly.

3. Since the reason for the environmental issue is unknown, it is essential to investigate and carry out research to understand the cause and prevent similar incidents in the future.

4. The solution implemented should be sustainable and not cause further disruptions to the planet's ecosystem.

ACTION:
After careful considerations, the best course of action would be to:

1. Deploy a team of experts to the planet to investigate the cause of the environmental issue. The team should comprise of environmental scientists, geologists, and other relevant experts.

2. Upon identifying the cause of the problem, the team should develop a solution that will restore the planet's ecosystem quickly. For instance, if the cause is due to industrial pollution, the solution could involve the installation of filtration systems, waste management, and other relevant measures to reduce pollution.

3. As the solution is being implemented, the team should also work towards restoring harmony among the inhabitants. This could involve organizing forums where the inhabitants can air their grievances and come up with ways to coexist peacefully.

4. Once the solution is implemented, the team should monitor the planet's ecosystem to ensure that it is sustainable and does not cause further disruptions.

The expected result of this action is the restoration of the planet's ecosystem, the reduction of suffering among the inhabitants, and the promotion of prosperity. By restoring harmony among the inhabitants, the planet can thrive, and the inhabitants can coexist peacefully. Additionally, the investigation and research carried out will increase understanding and prevent similar incidents in the future.
