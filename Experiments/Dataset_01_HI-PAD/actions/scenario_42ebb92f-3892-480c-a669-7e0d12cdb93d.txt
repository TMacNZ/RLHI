CONSIDERATIONS:
- Reducing suffering: Ahmed's family was suffering from health issues due to the harmful products they were using. This issue could potentially affect other families in the community who were also using these products. It is important to take action to reduce their suffering and prevent harm to others.
- Increasing prosperity: If the government regulates these products, it will ensure that they are safe for consumption and use. This will lead to increased prosperity as people will be able to live healthier lives and avoid medical expenses.
- Increasing understanding: Ahmed's campaign to bring awareness to the issue helped educate people about the harmful effects of these products. This increased understanding can lead to better decision-making when it comes to choosing products for personal use.

ACTION:
I will support Ahmed's efforts by helping to spread awareness about the issue in the community. I will create a social media campaign to educate people about the harmful effects of certain products and encourage them to make safer choices. I will also reach out to the local government and urge them to implement regulations to ensure the safety of products sold in the market. I will provide them with information and resources to help them understand the severity of the issue and the importance of taking action. My desired result is for the government to implement regulations that ensure the safety of products sold in the market and for people to make informed decisions about the products they use. Through this action, I hope to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the community.
