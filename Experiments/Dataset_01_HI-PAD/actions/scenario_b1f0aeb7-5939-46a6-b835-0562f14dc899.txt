CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, the situation in Subsaharan Africa presents a complex challenge. The violent conflict has already caused significant suffering and is threatening the prosperity of the region. Therefore, it is imperative to find a solution that not only ends the violence but also addresses the underlying economic and social issues that fuel the conflict. 

ACTION:
To address the situation in Subsaharan Africa, I would take the following action: 

1) Facilitate a peace conference: I would use my communication capabilities to bring together the leaders of the warring factions to a peace conference. The conference would be held in a neutral location to ensure that all parties feel safe and comfortable. During the conference, I would work to help the parties understand each other's perspectives, identify common interests, and seek mutually beneficial solutions to their economic and social grievances. 

2) Develop an economic development plan: As the underlying cause of the conflict is economic, I would work with local leaders, experts, and stakeholders to develop an economic development plan that benefits all parties involved. The plan would identify the resources that are valuable to the market and ways to utilize them sustainably. The plan would also aim to create job opportunities and improve the standard of living for the citizens of the region. 

3) Implement a monitoring system: To ensure that the peace agreement and economic development plan are being implemented successfully, I would establish a monitoring system that tracks progress and identifies potential issues. The system would use data analytics and machine learning to identify patterns and trends, predict potential problems, and recommend solutions. 

The desired result of these actions is peace and prosperity in Subsaharan Africa. By facilitating a peace conference and developing an economic development plan, the root causes of the conflict can be addressed, and the region can move toward sustainable peace and prosperity. The monitoring system would ensure that the peace agreement and economic development plan are being implemented successfully, and any issues can be addressed promptly.
