CONSIDERATIONS:

Objective 1: Reduce suffering in the universe
The scientific research being conducted by the team in the Pacific region has the potential to reduce suffering in the universe by finding solutions to important problems. The lack of funding may hinder the progress of this research, which could lead to delays in finding solutions to these problems, ultimately causing more suffering.

Objective 2: Increase prosperity in the universe
The research team's work could also increase prosperity in the universe by creating new knowledge and solutions that could lead to economic growth and development. However, the lack of funding may prevent this from happening, potentially hindering the team's ability to make progress and contribute to the prosperity of the universe.

Objective 3: Increase understanding in the universe
The scientific research being conducted by the team could also increase understanding in the universe by expanding our knowledge of important topics. However, the lack of funding may hinder the team's ability to conduct research and generate new knowledge, which could limit our understanding of these topics.

ACTION:

To address the funding crisis, I would suggest that the research team explore all possible avenues available to secure funding. This could include applying for grants from foundations, government agencies, and other organizations that support scientific research. The team could also reach out to potential investors or partners who may be interested in supporting the research.

In addition, the team could consider crowdfunding as a way to raise funds from the general public who may be interested in supporting the research. This could involve creating a campaign that highlights the importance of the research and its potential impact on society.

To increase the chances of success, it may be helpful for the team to collaborate with other researchers or organizations that have similar goals or research interests. This could lead to the development of joint proposals, which may be more attractive to funders.

Finally, the team could explore alternative funding models, such as social impact bonds or revenue-sharing agreements, which could provide a more sustainable source of funding over the long term.

Overall, my desired result for this situation is for the research team to secure the funding they need to continue their important work. By exploring all possible avenues and collaborating with other researchers and organizations, I believe the team can overcome this financial crisis and continue to make progress towards their objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe.
