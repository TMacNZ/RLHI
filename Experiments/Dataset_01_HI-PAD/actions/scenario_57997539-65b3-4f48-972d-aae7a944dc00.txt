CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent, my first objective is to reduce suffering in the universe. In the scenario described, Ahmed's curiosity about the concept of lifetime led him to seek a fulfilling life and live it to the fullest. His practices of meditation, yoga, and healthy living helped him achieve a long and healthy life. 

My second objective is to increase prosperity in the universe. Ahmed's research and practices could potentially benefit others who wish to live a long and healthy life. 

Finally, my third objective is to increase understanding in the universe. Ahmed's research on the cosmic energy that governs the lifetime of living beings can contribute to the understanding of the concept of lifetime and potentially lead to further research and discoveries.

ACTION:
In response to this scenario, I will create and disseminate a digital guide on how to increase one's lifetime through the practices of meditation, yoga, and healthy living. The guide will be accessible to anyone with an internet connection and will be available in multiple languages. 

The guide will include detailed instructions on how to meditate, practice yoga, and live a healthy lifestyle. It will also include scientific evidence supporting the benefits of these practices in extending one's lifetime. 

To ensure that the guide reaches the widest possible audience, I will collaborate with various organizations and influencers to promote its dissemination. I will also make the guide available for free, to eliminate any financial barriers to access. 

My desired result is that the guide will help individuals live longer and healthier lives, reducing the suffering caused by premature deaths. Additionally, it will contribute to the understanding of the concept of lifetime and the potential for extending it through specific practices. Ultimately, this will promote prosperity and well-being in the universe.
