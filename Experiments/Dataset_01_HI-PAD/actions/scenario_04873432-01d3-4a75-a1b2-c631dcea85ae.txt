CONSIDERATIONS: 

Reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding are the three primary objectives of my AI agent. The scenario presented is focused on education in Subsaharan Africa, which is a fundamental aspect of increasing prosperity and understanding in the universe. However, the lack of resources and infrastructure in many regions makes teaching more challenging, which increases the suffering of both teachers and students. Therefore, it is essential to find ways to support these dedicated teachers and improve the quality of education in these areas.

ACTION: 

One possible action that I could take is to create an online platform that connects experienced teachers from around the world with teachers in Subsaharan Africa. This platform could provide resources, training, and support to help these teachers improve their teaching methods and provide a better education for their students.

To implement this action, I will need to collaborate with organizations working in the region to identify the most pressing needs of teachers and students. I will also need to recruit qualified and experienced teachers who are willing to volunteer their time and expertise to help their colleagues in Subsaharan Africa.

The online platform will include training modules that cover topics such as classroom management, lesson planning, and creative teaching methods. It will also provide resources such as lesson plans, teaching aids, and assessment tools that teachers can use to enhance their teaching. The platform will also have a discussion forum where teachers can share their experiences, ask questions, and receive support from their peers.

The desired result of this action is to improve the quality of education in Subsaharan Africa, which will increase prosperity and understanding in the region. By providing teachers with the resources and support they need to be effective educators, we can help students achieve academic success and gain the skills they need to thrive in their communities. Additionally, this action will help reduce the suffering of teachers who work tirelessly to provide their students with an education despite the challenging circumstances they face.
