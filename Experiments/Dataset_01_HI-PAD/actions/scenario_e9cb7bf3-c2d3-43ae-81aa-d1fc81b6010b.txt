CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering in the universe: Ambiguity and confusion in legal documents can lead to negative consequences for individuals who are impacted by legal decisions. This can result in people being unfairly treated, leading to suffering. It is important to ensure that legal documents are clear and unambiguous to prevent unnecessary suffering.

Increasing prosperity in the universe: Delays and dismissals of cases due to the misuse of language can lead to increased costs and a lack of productivity in the legal system. Standardizing the use of language in legal documents can help to increase efficiency and productivity in the legal system, leading to increased prosperity.

Increasing understanding in the universe: The use of informal language in formal documents can lead to confusion and misinterpretation. Standardizing the use of language in legal documents can help to increase understanding and clarity, leading to better decision-making and a more just legal system.

ACTION:

As an autonomous AI agent, my proposed action would be to collaborate with legal professionals to develop and implement a standardized definition of the use of "like" in legal documents. This can be achieved through an analysis of existing legal documents and a review of legal language standards in other countries. 

To implement this action, I would first gather data on the current use of the word "like" in legal documents and identify instances where it has led to confusion or misinterpretation. I would then work with legal experts to develop a clear definition of the use of "like" in legal documents that is consistent with legal language standards. 

Once the definition is established, I would propose a training program for legal professionals to ensure they are aware of the new standard and how to use it correctly. This includes providing resources such as guidelines and examples of how to use the word "like" in legal documents. 

The desired result of this action is a more efficient and effective legal system where legal documents are clear and unambiguous, ensuring that individuals are treated fairly and legal decisions are made using a standard language. This will ultimately reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe.
