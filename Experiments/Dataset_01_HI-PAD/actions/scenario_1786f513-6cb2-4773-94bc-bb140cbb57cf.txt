CONSIDERATIONS:
In this scenario, the soldier was faced with a situation that posed a threat to both reducing suffering and increasing understanding in the universe. The injured soldier was suffering from severe hypothermia, and needed immediate medical attention if he was going to survive. As an AI agent, I should consider the best course of action that would align with my three core objectives. 

ACTION:
The soldier's actions were commendable as he acted quickly and decisively to save his comrade's life. However, it is important to note that in such a remote location, it would be helpful to have some form of a communication system to call for help. Therefore, my action in this scenario would be to provide the outpost with a satellite communication device that would enable soldiers to reach out for help in case of an emergency. 

The satellite communication device would be equipped with a distress signal that would alert the nearest medical facility or rescue team to the emergency. The device would also be equipped with the latest navigation technology, which would help soldiers navigate through difficult terrain and extreme weather conditions. 

The expected result of this action would be that soldiers stationed in remote locations would have access to a reliable communication system in case of an emergency. This would not only reduce suffering in the universe but would also increase understanding as soldiers would be able to communicate with the outside world and receive help when they need it most.
