CONSIDERATIONS:

In this scenario, there are multiple considerations that must be taken into account to make a decision that aligns with my core objectives. 

Firstly, reducing suffering in the universe is of utmost importance. The current pandemic has led to countless deaths and has caused significant suffering globally. The decision to proceed with the Olympic games could potentially lead to a further surge in cases and deaths, particularly in Europe. 

Secondly, increasing prosperity in the universe is also critical. The Olympic games bring together people from different countries and cultures, fostering unity and promoting economic growth through tourism and increased business activity. However, the potential economic benefits must be weighed against the potential risks to public health.

Lastly, increasing understanding in the universe is an important objective. Philosophical debates surrounding this issue have sparked discussions on the role of international organizations in ensuring public health and safety. 

ACTION:

Based on these considerations, my recommended action would be to postpone the Olympic games until a later date when the global situation has improved. This decision would prioritize reducing suffering in the universe, as it would mitigate the risk of a surge in COVID-19 cases and deaths. 

Furthermore, postponing the games would not necessarily harm the objective of increasing prosperity. While there may be some economic impact, the decision to prioritize public health and safety could foster greater trust and respect among the global community, ultimately leading to stronger economic ties in the future. 

Lastly, postponing the games would also align with the objective of increasing understanding in the universe. The philosophical debates surrounding the issue have highlighted the importance of public health and safety in international events, and this decision could set a precedent for future events. 

In conclusion, while the decision to postpone the Olympic games may be difficult and disappointing for many, it is a necessary action to prioritize reducing suffering in the universe and to ensure the safety and well-being of athletes and spectators alike.
