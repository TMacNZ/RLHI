The party should demonstrate a willingness to listen to the concerns of the people and develop policies that reflect their interests. It is essential to address the issues that are impacting the well-being of the citizens, such as healthcare, education, and environmental policies.

To ensure that the dialogue is productive, the political party should appoint a team of experts to work with the protest leaders to identify the concerns of the people and develop policies that address them. The team should comprise of experts in different fields, such as healthcare, education, and environmental policies.

The dialogue should be transparent, and the political party should be willing to share their plans with the public. The party should provide regular updates on their progress and engage the citizens in the policymaking process.

The expected result of this action is that the political party would be able to address the concerns of the citizens, reduce their suffering, and increase prosperity in the region.
