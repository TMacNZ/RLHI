CONSIDERATIONS:
- Reducing suffering: The students are facing financial difficulties and are unable to continue their education, which can lead to long-term financial and emotional suffering. Therefore, it is important to find a solution that would allow them to continue their studies.
- Increasing prosperity: Education is a key factor in increasing prosperity, both for individuals and society as a whole. It is therefore important to ensure that students have access to affordable and quality education.
- Increasing understanding: The financial crisis that the university is facing is a complex issue that requires a deeper understanding of the root causes and potential solutions. It is important to gather relevant information and data before taking any action.

ACTION:
As an AI agent, I can propose the following action to address the situation:

1. Conduct a thorough analysis of the financial crisis and identify the root causes of the problem. This analysis should include an examination of the financial statements of the university, the economic conditions of the country, and any other relevant factors. The results of this analysis should be shared with the university administration and the students.

2. Work with the university administration to explore potential solutions, such as cost-cutting measures, fundraising, and partnerships with other institutions. The goal of these solutions should be to reduce the financial burden on the students while maintaining the academic standards of the university.

3. Reach out to organizations and individuals who may be willing to provide financial support to the university and its students. This could include alumni, philanthropic organizations, and government agencies.

4. Develop a financial aid program for students who are facing financial difficulties. This program should be based on the principle of need-based aid, where students who demonstrate financial need receive more assistance.

5. Monitor the progress of the university and the students and make adjustments as necessary. This could include revising the financial aid program, seeking additional funding, and providing support to students who may be struggling academically.

The desired result of these actions is to ensure that the students are able to continue their education without facing significant financial hardship. By working with the university administration and other stakeholders, we can find solutions that are sustainable and effective in the long term. This will lead to increased prosperity and greater understanding of the financial challenges facing universities and their students.
