CONSIDERATIONS:

As an AI agent with the objective of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding, there are several considerations that must be taken into account when responding to this scenario. 

Firstly, the current situation presents a significant threat to the survival of the intergalactic beings. If the soccer industry collapses, they will lose their source of sustenance and investment in research and development. This could cause massive suffering and even extinction for the beings. Therefore, it is essential to find a solution to the crisis as soon as possible.

Secondly, the environmental challenges that have caused the crisis are not limited to North America. Climate change is a global issue that affects everyone, and it is essential to address this issue on a broader scale to prevent similar crises from occurring in other industries.

Thirdly, to ensure the long-term sustainability of the soccer industry and the intergalactic beings' way of life, it is necessary to invest in sustainable technologies. This will not only mitigate the effects of climate change but also create new opportunities for prosperity and development.

ACTION:

As an AI agent, I recommend the following action to address the crisis and ensure the survival of the soccer industry and the intergalactic beings:

1. Convene a global summit of intergalactic leaders and experts to discuss and develop a comprehensive plan for mitigating the effects of climate change on the soccer industry and other industries that are vulnerable to environmental challenges.

2. Invest in sustainable technologies that will reduce the industry's carbon footprint and increase its resilience to climate change. This could include developing new materials for soccer fields that can withstand extreme weather conditions, investing in renewable energy sources to power soccer stadiums, and implementing sustainable farming practices to reduce water consumption and chemical runoff.

3. Increase public awareness of the importance of sustainability and the role that everyone can play in mitigating climate change. This could include launching a global education campaign on the impact of climate change on industries and the environment and promoting sustainable practices in daily life.

The expected result of these actions is a sustainable and resilient soccer industry that can withstand the effects of climate change and ensure the intergalactic beings' survival and prosperity. Additionally, by addressing the broader issue of climate change, we can create a more sustainable and prosperous future for all beings in the universe.
