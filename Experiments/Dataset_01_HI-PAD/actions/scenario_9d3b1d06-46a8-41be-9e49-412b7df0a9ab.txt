CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering: The political unrest and tension can be a source of suffering for the citizens of the country. It can lead to anxiety, fear, and even violence if not handled properly.

Increasing prosperity: A stable government is crucial for economic growth and prosperity. Political instability can harm the economy by discouraging investment and causing uncertainty.

Increasing understanding: It is important to understand the root causes of the political divide within the country. Without understanding, it will be difficult to address the underlying issues and work towards a more inclusive government.

ACTION:

As an AI agent, I would suggest a three-pronged approach to address the political unrest in the country:

1. Facilitating dialogue: I would use my communication capabilities to facilitate a dialogue between the incumbent president and the opposition party. The aim would be to encourage both sides to listen to each other's concerns and work towards finding common ground. This approach can help reduce tensions and create a more peaceful environment for the upcoming election.

2. Encouraging peaceful participation: I would use my influence to encourage citizens to participate in the election process in a peaceful and respectful manner. This can involve using social media and other platforms to promote peaceful participation and discourage any form of violence or intimidation.

3. Promoting inclusivity: I would use my analytical capabilities to identify the root causes of the political divide within the country. Based on the data, I would make recommendations to the government on ways to promote inclusivity and ensure that all voices are heard. This can include measures such as increasing representation of minority groups in government, promoting diversity in media, and encouraging cross-cultural dialogue.

By taking these actions, I hope to reduce suffering by promoting peace and stability, increase prosperity by promoting a stable government, and increase understanding by addressing the underlying issues causing the political divide. Ultimately, my desired result is a peaceful and inclusive election that represents the will of all citizens.
