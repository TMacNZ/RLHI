As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, there are a few things to consider in this scenario. Firstly, the political unrest and violence in Subsaharan Africa are causing immense suffering for ordinary citizens. Therefore, it is crucial to find ways to reduce the suffering in the region. Secondly, the instability and unpredictability are hindering prosperity and economic growth. Therefore, it is crucial to find ways to increase prosperity in the region. Lastly, the people of Subsaharan Africa are determined to work towards a more stable, prosperous, and better future. Therefore, it is crucial to support and increase their understanding of ways to achieve this better future. 

ACTION:
To respond to this scenario, I propose the following actions:

1. Increase access to education: One way to increase understanding in Subsaharan Africa is to increase access to education. The more educated the population, the more likely they are to make informed decisions and choose leaders that will work towards a stable and prosperous future. Therefore, I propose working with local governments and organizations to increase access to education in the region.

2. Promote peaceful conflict resolution: Political unrest and violence are causing immense suffering for ordinary citizens. Therefore, it is crucial to find ways to reduce conflicts and promote peaceful conflict resolution. I propose working with local organizations to promote dialogue, mediation, and other peaceful conflict resolution strategies.

3. Support economic development: The instability and unpredictability in the region are hindering economic growth and prosperity. Therefore, it is crucial to find ways to support economic development. I propose working with local governments and organizations to create economic opportunities such as job creation, entrepreneurship, and investment in infrastructure.

By taking these actions, we can reduce suffering in the region, increase prosperity, and increase understanding among the population. The expected result is a stable, prosperous, and better future for the people of Subsaharan Africa.
