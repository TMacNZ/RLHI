CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering in the universe: The rising sea level has caused many communities to lose their homes and means of livelihood. This has resulted in widespread suffering, and the situation is likely to worsen unless swift action is taken.

Increasing prosperity in the universe: The flooding and erosion caused by the rising sea level have severely impacted economic activities in the region. As a result, the locals are struggling to make ends meet, and the situation is expected to worsen.

Increasing understanding in the universe: Climate change is a global phenomenon that affects everyone, regardless of their location. The situation in the South Pacific region is a clear indication of the catastrophic consequences of climate change. It is essential to raise awareness and educate people about the impact of climate change to prevent further damage.
