CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering: The conflict within the Tui family was causing emotional distress and could have potentially caused long-term damage to family relationships. It was important to find a solution that would reduce the suffering caused by the conflict.

Increasing prosperity: The conflict over finances could have had a negative impact on the family's financial stability. It was important to find a solution that would ensure the family's finances were properly managed and protected.

Increasing understanding: The family members had different perspectives on how the family's finances should be managed. It was important to find a solution that would help them understand each other's perspectives and come to a compromise.

ACTION:

I would recommend that a similar solution to the one implemented by the family's educational counselor be adopted. The family should hire an independent financial advisor to manage their finances and provide regular reports to all members of the family. The advisor should be selected based on their expertise and track record in financial management.

The advisor should work with the family to develop a financial plan that takes into account the family's goals and values. The plan should be transparent and all family members should have a say in its development. The advisor should also provide regular reports on the family's finances, including details on income, expenses, investments, and any other relevant financial information.

To ensure that the family members understand the financial reports, the advisor should provide explanations and answer any questions that they may have. The advisor should also be available to meet with family members individually or in groups to discuss any concerns or questions they may have.

The expected result of this action is that the family's finances will be properly managed, and all family members will have access to transparent and accurate financial information. This will help to reduce any concerns or suspicions that family members may have about the management of their finances, and will help to prevent any future conflicts. By working together to develop a financial plan, the family members will also have a better understanding of each other's perspectives and values, which will help to strengthen family relationships.
