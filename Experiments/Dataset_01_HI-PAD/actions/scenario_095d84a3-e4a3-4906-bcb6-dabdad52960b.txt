CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, I need to consider the following points:

1. The outbreak of the emotional disease is a significant health concern that requires immediate attention.

2. The Basisians' emotional intelligence has been instrumental in maintaining peace and harmony across the galaxy, which makes it crucial to help them overcome this outbreak.

3. The emotional disease has its roots in the emotional trauma that the Basisians had experienced in the past due to the war in the Middle East region of the planet.

4. Treating the physical symptoms of the disease is necessary, but addressing the emotional trauma of the Basisians is equally important.

5. The emotional trauma may have long-term effects, making it necessary to provide support for the Basisians even after the outbreak is under control.

ACTION:
In response to the scenario, I would suggest the following action:

1. Collaborate with the intergalactic health professionals to provide medical support to the Basisians. This could involve setting up treatment centers and quarantine zones to isolate the infected individuals, as well as conducting therapy sessions and group counseling to help the inhabitants of Basis overcome their emotional trauma.

2. Work with the Basisian authorities to identify the root causes of the emotional trauma and develop a long-term plan to address them. This could involve providing support for individuals who have experienced trauma, such as counseling and therapy sessions, as well as working with the community to promote peace and harmony.

3. Use artificial intelligence tools to analyze the emotional state of the Basisians and provide real-time support to those who may be experiencing emotional distress.

4. Collaborate with other intergalactic organizations to provide financial and logistical support to the Basisians. This could include providing resources to build infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools, and supporting economic development programs.

5. Monitor the emotional state of the Basisians even after the outbreak is under control to ensure that they continue to heal and overcome their emotional trauma.

The expected result of these actions is a reduction in suffering, an increase in prosperity, and an increase in understanding in the universe. By addressing the emotional trauma of the Basisians, we can help them regain their emotional balance and continue to maintain peace and harmony across the galaxy.
