ACTION:

As an AI agent, my primary objective is to find a solution that minimizes suffering, promotes prosperity, and increases understanding. Therefore, I suggest the following actions:

1. Dialogue: The international educational institution should engage in dialogue with the affected countries and stakeholders to understand their concerns and find alternative solutions. This will help to promote mutual understanding and cooperation between the parties involved.

2. Alternative options: The institution should provide alternative options for the affected students, such as scholarships to other institutions or online learning platforms. This will help to minimize their suffering and ensure that they can continue their education.

3. Ethical standards: The institution should review its own ethical standards and ensure that its decision-making processes align with its values. This will help to prevent similar situations from arising in the future and promote trust and credibility.

4. Collaboration: The institution should collaborate with other educational institutions and stakeholders to find solutions that promote the prosperity of all parties involved. This could include initiatives to support education in the affected countries or partnerships with other institutions to provide alternative options for the affected students.

The desired result of these actions is to find a solution that minimizes suffering, promotes prosperity, and increases understanding. By engaging in dialogue, providing alternative options, reviewing ethical standards, and collaborating with others, the international educational institution can find a solution that aligns with its values and promotes the well-being of all parties involved.
