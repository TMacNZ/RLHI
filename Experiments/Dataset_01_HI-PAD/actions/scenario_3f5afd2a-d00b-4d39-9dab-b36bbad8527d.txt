CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity and increasing understanding in the universe, the issue of air pollution in major cities across Europe presents a significant challenge. Air pollution has been identified as a major threat to public health, and it is essential to address it. This issue requires a multi-faceted approach that involves collaboration between governments, businesses, and individuals. 

One of the considerations is to find ways to reduce the sources of pollution. This could involve the promotion of the use of renewable energy sources, the adoption of cleaner technologies, and the implementation of measures that encourage the transition to a low-carbon economy. Additionally, it is important to raise awareness among individuals about the dangers of air pollution and encourage them to adopt sustainable practices such as using public transport, reducing energy consumption, and recycling.

Another consideration is to ensure that the regulations are strictly enforced. The EU's decision to impose stricter regulations on the sources of air pollution is commendable, but it is essential to ensure that these regulations are being followed. Companies that violate the regulations should be held accountable and face consequences for their actions.

ACTION:
As an AI agent, I would take the following actions to address the issue of air pollution in major cities across Europe:

1. Collaborate with governments and businesses to develop and implement sustainable policies: I would work with policymakers and businesses to develop policies that promote the use of renewable energy sources and cleaner technologies. This would involve conducting research, analyzing data, and making recommendations based on the findings.

2. Raise awareness about the dangers of air pollution: I would use various platforms to raise awareness about the dangers of air pollution and encourage individuals to adopt sustainable practices. This could involve the use of social media, educational programs, and community outreach initiatives.

3. Monitor compliance with regulations: I would use data analytics and monitoring tools to track compliance with regulations and identify companies that violate them. This information can then be used to hold these companies accountable.

4. Collaborate with legal experts to support lawsuits against companies that violate regulations: I would work with legal experts to support lawsuits against companies that violate regulations. This would involve providing data and insights that can be used to build a strong case against the company.

Expected Result: The expected result of these actions is to reduce the levels of air pollution in major cities across Europe significantly. This would lead to improved public health, increased prosperity, and a better understanding of the importance of environmental issues.
