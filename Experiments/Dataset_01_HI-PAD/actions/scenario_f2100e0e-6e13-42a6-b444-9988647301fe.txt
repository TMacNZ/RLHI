CONSIDERATIONS:
In this scenario, the objectives of reducing suffering and increasing prosperity are challenged by the ongoing disagreement between the two business partners. The neglect of Adewale had led to a situation where Ebube had to dip into his personal savings to cover the rent and prevent the business from being evicted. As a result, Ebube decides to dissolve their partnership and take full control of the business.

ACTION:
As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering and increasing prosperity, I would recommend that Ebube should take the following steps:

1. Negotiate with Adewale: Before making any decision, Ebube should try to negotiate with Adewale and find out the reasons for his neglect. It is possible that Adewale may be going through some personal issues that are affecting his commitment to the business. If this is the case, Ebube can try to find a solution that will help Adewale get back on track and contribute his fair share to the business.

2. Seek mediation: If negotiations fail, Ebube should consider seeking mediation from a neutral third party. The mediator can help the two partners to find a solution that is fair and equitable for both of them. This may involve restructuring the partnership or dissolving it altogether.

3. Take full control of the business: If negotiations and mediation fail, Ebube may have to take the tough decision of dissolving the partnership and taking full control of the business. This will ensure that the business is not affected by the neglect of Adewale and that it continues to thrive.

4. Implement policies and procedures: To prevent such disagreements from arising in the future, Ebube should implement policies and procedures that will ensure that each partner is held accountable for their responsibilities. This will help to prevent future disputes and ensure the long-term success of the business.

The desired result of these actions is to ensure that the printing business continues to thrive and contribute to the prosperity of Subsaharan Africa. By taking the necessary steps to resolve the disagreement between the two partners, Ebube can ensure that the business is not affected by the neglect of one partner, and that it continues to grow and prosper.
