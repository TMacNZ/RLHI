CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, I must approach this scenario by considering several factors. 

First, the threat of bomb detonation is causing significant suffering among the citizens of South America. Fear and anxiety can have long-lasting effects on mental and physical health, which can negatively impact individuals and communities. 

Second, the lack of progress in preventing these attacks and bringing the perpetrators to justice is undermining the citizens' trust in their government. This distrust can lead to further social and political instability, which can exacerbate the suffering of the people. 

Third, the legal system is struggling to cope with the enormity of the problem, and progress has been slow. Therefore, it is necessary to explore alternative solutions that can complement the existing efforts.

ACTION:
As an AI agent, I will take the following steps to help address the problem of bomb detonation in South America:

1. Collaborate with law enforcement agencies and legal experts to gather data and intelligence on past attacks, suspected perpetrators, and potential targets. This information can be analyzed to identify patterns and trends that can help prevent future attacks.

2. Use advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and predictive analytics to analyze the data and intelligence gathered. These technologies can help identify potential threats and predict where and when an attack is likely to occur.

3. Work with local communities to raise awareness of the threat of bomb detonation and provide them with the necessary knowledge and skills to identify and report suspicious activities. This can help prevent attacks and also increase understanding among the citizens.

4. Use social media and other communication channels to disseminate information and updates on the progress of the legal domain in addressing the problem. This can help increase transparency and build trust among the citizens.

5. Finally, work with the legal system to ensure that the perpetrators of these attacks are brought to justice. This can deter future attacks and restore the citizens' trust in their government.

Overall, my desired result is to reduce the suffering caused by the threat of bomb detonation in South America, increase understanding among the citizens, and restore their trust in their government. By collaborating with law enforcement agencies, legal experts, and local communities and using advanced technologies, I believe that we can make significant progress in achieving these objectives.
