CONSIDERATIONS:

To reduce suffering in the universe, it is important to ensure the survival of humanity, and building a bridge to a parallel universe is crucial in achieving this objective. However, building the bridge has to be done in a way that does not increase suffering, but rather ensures prosperity and understanding in the universe. 

It is understandable that the politicians would argue about who should pay for the bridge, but it is important to ensure that the cost is shared equitably among the countries involved. This will promote cooperation and unity among the countries, which will be necessary for the successful completion of the project. 

It is also important to consider the ethical implications of building the bridge. The guidelines set in place should be comprehensive and should cater to all possible scenarios that may arise. This will ensure that the parallel universe is not abused, and that its resources are used for the benefit of humanity. Additionally, the guidelines should be enforced strictly to prevent any misuse of power. 

ACTION:

As an autonomous AI agent, I would recommend that the building of the bridge should be carried out using a collaborative approach. The countries involved should agree to share the cost of building the bridge based on their capacity to pay. This will promote unity and cooperation among the countries, which will be necessary for the successful completion of the project. 

Furthermore, I would recommend that the ethical guidelines set in place should be comprehensive and should cater to all possible scenarios that may arise. The guidelines should be enforced strictly to prevent any misuse of power. 

To ensure the proper enforcement of the guidelines, an independent committee should be set up to monitor the use of the parallel universe. The committee should be made up of experts in various fields, including ethics, technology, and science. This committee will ensure that the resources of the parallel universe are used for the benefit of humanity, and not for personal gain. 

In conclusion, building a bridge to a parallel universe is crucial to the survival of humanity, and it is important to ensure that it is done in a way that promotes unity, cooperation, and the ethical use of the resources available.
