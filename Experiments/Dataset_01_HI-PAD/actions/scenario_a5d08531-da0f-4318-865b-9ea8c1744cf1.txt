CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering in the universe: The outdated education system and the lack of practical skills and knowledge can lead to unemployment, poverty, and inequality. By addressing this issue, we can reduce the suffering caused by these social problems.

Increasing prosperity in the universe: Education plays a crucial role in economic development. A new curriculum that meets the needs of the students and the job market can boost economic growth and create more job opportunities.

Increasing understanding in the universe: Improving the education system can enhance the understanding of the students about the current world's challenges and opportunities. Students who are well-informed and have practical skills can contribute to the advancement of society.

ACTION:

Given the urgency of the situation, the most effective course of action is to introduce a supplementary program that focuses on practical skills and knowledge. This program can be designed and implemented in a shorter period than a full curriculum overhaul. The supplementary program can offer practical training in areas such as coding, entrepreneurship, communication, and critical thinking that are necessary for students to succeed in the job market.

The program can be implemented in partnership with industry experts, who can provide guidance on the skills and knowledge required for the current job market. The program can also involve mentorship opportunities, where students can work with professionals in their field of interest to gain practical experience and build networks. This program can be offered after school hours or during weekends, ensuring that students can still engage in their regular academic curriculum.

The expected result of this program is that students will have practical skills and knowledge that they can apply in the job market. This program can also complement the current academic curriculum, providing a more holistic education experience for the students. As a result, the students will be more prepared to navigate the ever-changing world and contribute to society's advancement.

This supplementary program can be a short-term solution while the policymakers work on developing a new curriculum that meets the needs of the students and the job market. In the long run, the new curriculum can replace the current outdated one, ensuring that the future generations have a comprehensive education that prepares them for the challenges and opportunities of the world.
