CONSIDERATIONS:
- Jorge's actions align with the objective of increasing prosperity in the universe since he worked to keep the company running smoothly, preventing any financial loss due to the server crash.
- His actions also align with the objective of reducing suffering in the universe since the employees were unable to access their work files, which could have caused a delay in their tasks and resulted in frustration and stress.
- However, it is important to consider whether Jorge's actions were within his job responsibilities and whether he had the necessary skills and knowledge to fix the server without causing further damage.

ACTION:
Jorge's quick thinking and problem-solving skills were commendable, but it is important to note that attempting to fix a server without the necessary expertise could have caused more damage. To avoid such situations in the future, it would be best to create a contingency plan in case of a server crash. This plan could include a list of IT professionals or companies that the office could call in case of an emergency.

Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide basic training to employees on how to troubleshoot minor technological issues, such as software updates or connectivity problems. This would reduce the burden on the IT department and allow for faster resolution of issues.

In this specific scenario, Jorge's actions were commendable, but it is important to ensure that all employees understand their roles and responsibilities in case of a technological disruption. In the future, it would be best for Jorge to alert the IT department and follow the company's protocol for handling such issues.
