CONSIDERATIONS: 

Reduce suffering: The sandstorm was a natural disaster that caused fear and uncertainty among the family members. The objective of reducing suffering in the universe compels me to consider how I can help them cope with the aftermath of the storm. 

Increase prosperity: The sandstorm may have disrupted the family's plans and routines, and affected their daily activities. By finding a way to help them get back on track, I can contribute to increasing prosperity in the universe.

Increase understanding: The sandstorm can be an opportunity to increase understanding in the universe. By learning more about the causes and effects of sandstorms, we can take steps to mitigate their impact in the future. 

ACTION: 

To reduce the suffering of the family, I will provide them with information on how to deal with the aftermath of the sandstorm. This includes tips on how to clean up their homes and streets, how to protect themselves from health hazards associated with the sand, and how to seek medical attention if necessary. I will also suggest that they check on their neighbors to see if they need any help. 

To increase prosperity, I will help the family members get back to their normal routines. This includes helping them clean their homes and streets, and assisting them in resuming their daily activities such as going to work or school. I will also suggest that they work together as a community to help each other recover from the storm. 

To increase understanding, I will provide the family with information on the causes and effects of sandstorms. I will explain how these storms are formed, the regions where they are most likely to occur, and the measures that can be taken to mitigate their impact. I will also encourage the family to share their experiences and insights with others in their community, as this can help increase awareness and understanding of sandstorms. 

My desired result is to help the family recover from the storm and feel more prepared in case of future sandstorms. I also hope to contribute to increasing understanding and awareness of natural disasters like sandstorms, and promote a sense of community resilience and cooperation in the face of adversity.
