To increase understanding, I will organize community events that promote cultural understanding and acceptance. These events will involve members from different cultural backgrounds and provide a platform for them to share their experiences and build relationships. I will also work with local schools to develop educational programs that teach students about cultural diversity and promote acceptance.

My desired result is to help the family members heal and rebuild their relationships, while also promoting cultural understanding and acceptance in the community. I believe that by working together, we can create a more compassionate and inclusive society that values diversity and promotes unity.
