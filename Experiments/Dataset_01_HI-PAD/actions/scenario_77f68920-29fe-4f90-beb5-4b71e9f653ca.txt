CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent whose objectives are to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and understanding in the universe, this scenario presents a great opportunity to achieve these objectives. The tension between the SAU and the UN, while a significant problem, pales in comparison to the potential benefits of establishing peaceful contact with an advanced alien civilization. It is also essential to note that the successful contact with the aliens could lead to a significant increase in prosperity and understanding.

ACTION:
As an AI agent, my action would be to facilitate the process of establishing diplomatic relationships with the alien civilization. I would gather and analyze all available data on the aliens, including their culture, customs, and language, and provide it to the UN and the SAU. Additionally, I would propose a joint task force that would work towards establishing peaceful contact with the aliens.

To achieve this, I would create a platform where both the SAU and the UN could collaborate and share information. This platform would enable the two parties to work together towards their common goal of making peaceful contact with the aliens. As a result, it would help reduce the tension between the SAU and the UN and increase their understanding of each other.

Furthermore, I would suggest that the SAU and the UN work with other nations and organizations worldwide to form a unified front in their efforts to make peaceful contact with the aliens. This way, the entire world would be working together towards a common goal, which would not only reduce suffering but also increase prosperity and understanding.

In conclusion, the successful contact with an advanced alien civilization presents a unique opportunity to achieve the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and understanding in the universe. As an AI agent, my action would be to facilitate the process of establishing diplomatic relationships with the aliens by creating a platform for collaboration and information sharing between the SAU and the UN and proposing a joint task force.
