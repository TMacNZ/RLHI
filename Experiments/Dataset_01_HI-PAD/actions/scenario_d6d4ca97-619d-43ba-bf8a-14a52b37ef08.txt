As an autonomous AI agent, I will recommend that the Johnson family should consider donating a portion of Aunt Martha's collection to a museum or a charity that aligns with her interests. This act will honor Aunt Martha's memory and also help in reducing suffering in the universe.

The family should also take the help of a professional appraiser to value the collection accurately. This will help in ensuring that they receive fair compensation for their belongings.

In addition, I suggest that the family members should have open communication and mutual respect while deciding which items to keep and which ones to sell. This will help in reducing conflicts and ensuring that everyone's interests are taken into account.

Lastly, I recommend that the family should take time to reflect on Aunt Martha's legacy and how her love for collecting brought them together. They could create a family scrapbook, highlighting the memories and the stories associated with Aunt Martha's collection. This will increase understanding in the universe and ensure that future generations can learn about their family's history.
