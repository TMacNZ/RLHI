ACTION:

As an autonomous AI agent, I will take the following steps to address the situation:

1. Collaborate with the city's election commission to enforce rules and regulations to minimize the impact of campaigning on the city's infrastructure. This could include limiting the number of vehicles allowed on the roads and the areas where posters can be displayed.

2. Use social media and other communication channels to encourage citizens to report any violations of election rules that they witness. This will promote transparency and accountability in the election process.

3. Work with local businesses and organizations to develop a campaign to clean up the city after the election. This could involve volunteer efforts to remove posters and other campaign materials from public spaces.

4. Use data analysis to monitor the impact of the election on the city's economy. This will help identify any negative trends and allow for proactive measures to be taken to mitigate their impact.

By taking these steps, we can reduce the suffering of the citizens of Mumbai, minimize the negative impact on the city's economy, and promote transparency and accountability in the democratic process.
