CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering: The disagreement between the family members could lead to tensions and disputes, which could cause emotional distress and suffering. It is essential to find a solution that will not cause any harm to any individual.

Increasing prosperity: Economic development is necessary for prosperity, but not at the cost of destroying the environment. It is essential to find a solution that promotes sustainable economic growth while protecting the forest's biodiversity.

Increasing understanding: It is necessary to promote understanding and awareness of the importance of preserving the rainforest's ecosystem. It is crucial to educate the family members on the long-term benefits of preserving the environment.

ACTION:

The first step is to organize a family meeting to discuss the issue and understand each other's perspectives. Maria can explain the importance of preserving the rainforest and its impact on the environment, economy, and society. She can also provide examples of other communities that have successfully implemented sustainable practices and achieved economic growth.

Next, the family can discuss potential solutions that promote economic development while protecting the environment. For example, they can explore eco-tourism opportunities, sustainable farming practices, and responsible mining and logging practices. They can also discuss the long-term benefits of preserving the forest, such as increased carbon sequestration, which can help mitigate climate change.

To increase understanding, Maria can organize educational workshops on environmental conservation and sustainable development. She can invite experts to speak about the benefits of preserving the forest and the negative consequences of deforestation. She can also organize field trips to nearby conservation areas to showcase the beauty and importance of preserving the ecosystem.

The desired result is to find a solution that promotes sustainable economic growth while preserving the environment. By promoting understanding and awareness, the family can work together to find a solution that benefits everyone and protects the Amazon rainforest's biodiversity.
