CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering: Ngozi's friend, Chipo, was facing a potentially significant prison sentence, which would have been devastating for her family. By helping to prove Chipo's innocence, Ngozi was able to reduce the suffering of her friend and her friend's loved ones.

Increasing prosperity: Protecting intellectual property rights is crucial for promoting innovation and economic growth. If Chipo had been found guilty, it would have set a dangerous precedent, discouraging researchers from pursuing their work and potentially stifling progress in the field. By fighting for Chipo's innocence and proving that the institution had stolen their work, Ngozi was able to protect the prosperity of the research community and ensure that researchers are fairly compensated for their hard work.

Increasing understanding: By speaking out about the importance of intellectual property rights and sharing her story, Ngozi can help to increase understanding among the public and policymakers about the challenges facing researchers in Subsaharan Africa. She can also help to raise awareness about the need for stronger legal protections for intellectual property, which could lead to greater understanding and cooperation between nations.

ACTION:

Ngozi should continue to advocate for the protection of intellectual property rights in Subsaharan Africa. This could involve working with policymakers to strengthen legal protections for researchers and innovators, as well as educating the public about the importance of respecting intellectual property.

Ngozi could also work to help build networks of support for researchers in the region, connecting them with resources and organizations that can help them to protect their work and ensure that they are fairly compensated for their contributions.

Finally, Ngozi should continue to support her friend Chipo, both emotionally and professionally. She can help to connect Chipo with other researchers and organizations that can provide support and guidance as she continues to pursue her work.

By taking these actions, Ngozi can help to promote greater prosperity, understanding, and reduced suffering in Subsaharan Africa and beyond.
