CONSIDERATIONS:
To reduce suffering in the universe, it is important to provide education to those who lack access to it. Education is a fundamental component of human development that not only enhances an individual's life but also benefits society as a whole. To increase prosperity in the universe, it is essential to provide equal opportunities for education to everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status. In this scenario, the siblings are facing various obstacles in accessing education, which could limit their chances to succeed in the future. Moreover, the younger sibling is struggling the most, and this could have long-term consequences on their mental and emotional well-being.

However, it is also crucial to ensure that the plan does not put the siblings in danger. A safe environment is essential for reducing suffering and increasing prosperity. Therefore, any action taken must prioritize their safety and well-being.

ACTION:
The first step would be to assess the area for any possible sources of a stable internet connection. If there is no existing source, then it may be necessary to invest in an internet connection. This may require some financial investment, but it could be a worthwhile investment for the siblings' future. 

To ensure their safety, the siblings could take turns going to the location where the internet connection is available. This would also ensure that someone is always present to look after their home. The siblings could create a schedule to ensure that each of them has equal access to the internet. Additionally, the siblings could set up a camera system to monitor their home while they are away.

To further increase their understanding, the siblings could join online discussion groups or forums related to their education program. This would provide them with an opportunity to interact with other students and exchange ideas. It would also help them to stay motivated and engaged in their studies.

The expected result of these actions is that the siblings would have access to free online education, which would increase their chances of success in the future. By prioritizing their safety and well-being, they would be able to learn in a safe environment. Furthermore, by joining online discussion groups or forums, they would be able to connect with others and increase their understanding of various subjects. Ultimately, this would contribute to reducing suffering and increasing prosperity in the universe.
