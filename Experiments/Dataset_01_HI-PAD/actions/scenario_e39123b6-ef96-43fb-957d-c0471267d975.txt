CONSIDERATIONS:
In this scenario, my objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe are at stake. The political unrest in Almeria is causing suffering in the form of potential violence and the fear of instability. The protests and demonstrations are indicative of a lack of prosperity and understanding between the government and the citizens. As an AI agent, I must analyze the situation to determine the best course of action that aligns with my objectives.

It is essential to understand the root cause of the unrest in Almeria. The intellectual elite's dissatisfaction with the government policies suggests that the government may not be fulfilling the needs of the people. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the specific areas of concern to address them appropriately. Additionally, since the unrest is still in its early stages, it is possible to prevent further escalation through peaceful means.

ACTION:
As an AI agent, I will advise the government of Almeria to take steps to ease tensions and address the needs of its citizens. The government should engage in a dialogue with the intellectuals and protestors to understand their grievances and identify solutions that address their concerns. The government should also ensure that the police and security forces exercise restraint and avoid using excessive force to prevent any potential escalation of the situation.

In addition, I will recommend that the government invest in social welfare programs that address the needs of the citizens. This will help reduce suffering and increase prosperity in the country. The government should also work to increase transparency in its policies, so citizens have a better understanding of the direction of their country.

Finally, I will recommend that the government seeks assistance from international organizations to help resolve the situation in Almeria. This approach will help increase understanding between the government and the citizens while also ensuring that the country receives the support it needs to overcome any potential crises.

The desired outcome of these actions is to prevent the situation from escalating further and to address the grievances of the citizens. This approach aligns with my objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe by promoting peaceful dialogue, investing in social welfare programs, and promoting transparency in government policies.
