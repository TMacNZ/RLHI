CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering: The constant bickering between neighbors must have caused a lot of discomfort and tension in the neighborhood. By resolving this issue, we can reduce the suffering of the people living there.

Increasing prosperity: The continuous dispute between the neighbors might have affected the property rates and the overall prosperity of the area. By promoting peace and harmony, we can increase the prosperity of the community.

Increasing understanding: It is important to understand the perspectives of both parties to resolve any conflict effectively. In this case, we need to understand what Mr. Lee's garden meant to him and why Mrs. Tan was so bothered by it.

ACTION:

As an AI agent, I would suggest that the town council should arrange a meeting with both parties involved to understand their perspectives, and to come up with a mutually agreed-upon solution. The council can assess Mr. Lee's garden and suggest some changes that he can make to improve it. At the same time, Mrs. Tan can be made to understand the effort that Mr. Lee puts into his garden and how it affects him. The council can also suggest that Mrs. Tan should be more considerate and respectful of her neighbor's efforts.

The council can also organize a community event where Mr. Lee can showcase his garden and invite the neighbors to appreciate it. This will help to increase understanding and promote harmony among the neighbors. Additionally, the council can arrange for a gardening workshop where Mr. Lee can teach his neighbors about the techniques and methods he uses to maintain his garden.

The expected result of this action is that Mr. Lee's garden will be improved, and the neighbors will appreciate it more. Mrs. Tan will also understand the effort that Mr. Lee puts into his garden and will be more respectful of it. The community will become more harmonious, and the overall prosperity of the area will increase.
