CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering: The heatwave and increased air pollution are causing discomfort and health issues for the citizens of Lima. Therefore, reducing suffering should be a top priority.

Increasing prosperity: The environmental crisis in Lima could negatively impact the city's economic growth and stability. Therefore, it is important to find solutions that not only address the immediate crisis but also promote long-term prosperity.

Increasing understanding: Climate change is a complex issue that requires a deep understanding of the science behind it. Therefore, educating the citizens of Lima on the causes and impacts of climate change can help increase their awareness and motivate them to take action.

ACTION:

One action that could be taken to address the environmental crisis in Lima is to implement a city-wide green roof policy. Green roofs involve planting vegetation on rooftops, which can help reduce the urban heat island effect and improve air quality. This approach has been successful in other cities, such as Toronto and Chicago.

To implement this policy, the government of Lima could offer incentives to building owners who install green roofs, such as tax breaks or subsidies. The city could also provide technical assistance to ensure that the roofs are installed properly and that the vegetation is maintained.

The desired result of this action is a reduction in the ambient temperature in Lima, which could improve the public health and comfort of the citizens. Additionally, green roofs can help reduce energy consumption by providing insulation and reducing the need for air conditioning, which could lead to long-term economic benefits for the city. Finally, educating the citizens of Lima on the benefits of green roofs can help increase their understanding of climate change and motivate them to take action to reduce their own carbon footprint.
