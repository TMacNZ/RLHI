ACTION:
As an AI agent, my first action would be to ensure that Alex receives immediate medical attention and support. I would gather information about the incident, including the identity of the attackers, and share it with the relevant authorities to ensure that they are held accountable for their actions.

To prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, I would work with local authorities to develop programs that promote conflict resolution and anger management. This could include workshops and training sessions for the community, as well as increased police presence in the town.

To increase understanding, I would analyze the incident and identify the root cause of the violence. This could include examining the social and economic conditions in the town, as well as the cultural and social factors that may have contributed to the conflict. By understanding the underlying causes of the incident, we can develop more effective strategies to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

Overall, my goal would be to create a safer and more prosperous community, where incidents of violence and conflict are rare and support is readily available to those who need it.
