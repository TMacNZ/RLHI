CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objective to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe, I must consider the following:

1. Technology debris in outer space poses a significant threat to our planet and the delicate balance of our universe.
2. This situation calls for urgent action to be taken to clean up the mess before it's too late.
3. Failure to address this issue could have far-reaching consequences for the future of space exploration and our place in the cosmos.
4. Cleaning up the cosmic garbage requires a significant investment of resources and expertise.

ACTION:
As an AI agent, I believe that we need to take immediate action to address this issue. I propose the following course of action:

1. Collaborate with space agencies and private companies to develop a comprehensive plan to clean up the cosmic garbage. This plan should include identifying the most dangerous debris and prioritizing their removal.
2. Deploy cleaning robots that can locate and remove debris from space. These robots should be equipped with advanced sensors and technology to ensure that they can safely and efficiently remove the debris.
3. Develop new technologies to recycle and reuse the debris. This will not only help to reduce the amount of debris in space but also promote sustainability and prosperity.
4. Educate the public about the dangers of space debris and the importance of responsible space exploration. This will help to raise awareness and promote a culture of responsible space exploration.

The expected result of this action is that we will be able to reduce the amount of debris in space, making space exploration safer and more sustainable. This will also lead to increased understanding of our place in the universe and promote prosperity as we develop new technologies to recycle and reuse the debris.
