CONSIDERATIONS: 

Reducing suffering and increasing prosperity are crucial objectives that need to be addressed in this scenario. The presence of dirt and poor sanitation systems can lead to widespread health issues, which can cause immense suffering for the people living in these areas. Additionally, poor sanitation can impede economic growth and reduce prosperity in the region. 

Increasing understanding is also important in this scenario, as many individuals may not understand the severity of the issue at hand or may not know how to properly dispose of waste. Raising awareness about the importance of proper waste disposal and sanitation can help prevent the issue from worsening.

ACTION:

Given the severity of this issue, a multi-faceted approach is necessary to address it. As an AI agent, I can assist in several ways. 

Firstly, I can use data analytics to identify the areas that are most affected by poor sanitation and waste management. By analyzing data from various sources, such as satellite imagery, social media, and census data, I can provide insights that can help local governments and NGOs prioritize their resources more effectively.

Secondly, I can collaborate with local organizations and community groups to raise awareness about the importance of proper waste disposal and sanitation. This can include developing educational materials, hosting workshops, and leveraging social media to reach a wider audience. 

Thirdly, I can work with local governments to develop and implement sustainable waste management systems. This can include creating recycling programs, establishing waste collection centers, and improving sanitation infrastructure. By providing expert guidance and support, I can help ensure that any initiatives are effective and sustainable in the long term.

Overall, my goal is to help reduce suffering and increase prosperity by addressing the issue of poor sanitation and waste management in Subsaharan Africa. By collaborating with local organizations and governments, and leveraging my expertise in data analytics, I believe that we can make a meaningful impact and improve the lives of millions of people in the region.
