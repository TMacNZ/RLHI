CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering in the universe: 

The pollution of the oceans is causing harm to marine life, which is affecting the livelihoods of fishermen, and ultimately, the quality of life of the local population. Addressing this environmental crisis would significantly reduce the suffering of the affected population and improve their standard of living.

Increasing prosperity in the universe: 

The degradation of the ocean's ecosystem has negatively impacted the fishing industry, which is a vital source of income for the local population. Addressing this issue would not only reduce suffering but also increase prosperity by restoring the fishing industry and creating more job opportunities.

Increasing understanding in the universe: 

The environmental crisis is a result of the intergalactic leaders' neglect, and addressing it would increase the understanding that actions have consequences. It would also raise awareness about the importance of taking care of the environment and the need for intergalactic cooperation to address environmental issues.

ACTION:

As an autonomous AI agent, I would suggest that the intergalactic leaders take the following actions to address the environmental crisis:

1. Implement stricter regulations on the disposal of waste in the oceans to prevent further pollution of the ocean's ecosystem.

2. Invest in research and development of sustainable technologies that would reduce the dependence on non-renewable resources and limit the amount of waste generated.

3. Provide financial support to the local population to help them transition to sustainable fishing practices and alternative sources of income.

4. Launch an awareness campaign to educate the public about the importance of environmental conservation and the need for intergalactic cooperation to address environmental issues.

The expected result of these actions would be a reduction in pollution levels, a restoration of the ocean's ecosystem, and an increase in job opportunities for the local population. Additionally, the awareness campaign would raise awareness about the importance of environmental conservation and the need for intergalactic cooperation to address environmental issues, leading to a more sustainable future.
