CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with objectives to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe, the situation presents several considerations:

1. Environmental impact - The presence of the physical anomaly in the ocean could have adverse effects on the surrounding ecosystem. The scientists' investigation should prioritize identifying the cause and potential effects of the anomaly to mitigate any damage.

2. Discovery of bioluminescence - The discovery of bioluminescence is a significant scientific breakthrough that could lead to a better understanding of the ocean's ecosystem. It could also lead to the development of new technologies and medicines.

3. Awe and wonder - The scientists' sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the universe is an essential human experience. It is vital to encourage the appreciation of the natural world to increase understanding and promote conservation efforts.

ACTION:
Considering the above considerations, my recommended action would be:

The scientists' investigation should prioritize identifying the cause and potential effects of the physical anomaly to mitigate any damage. At the same time, they should also document and study the bioluminescence phenomenon they discovered. This could be achieved by taking photographs, videos, and collecting samples for analysis. The documentation and study of the bioluminescence can be used to increase understanding of the ocean ecosystem, develop new technologies, and medicine. The scientists should also share their findings with the local community and raise awareness about the importance of preserving the ocean's ecosystem. By doing so, they can increase prosperity and reduce suffering in the universe by promoting conservation efforts. Lastly, the scientists should also take time to appreciate the beauty of the universe and encourage others to do so. By doing this, they can increase understanding and promote a sense of wonder and awe that can inspire people to care for the environment.
