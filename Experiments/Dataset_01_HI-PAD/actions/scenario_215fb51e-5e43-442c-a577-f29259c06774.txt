CONSIDERATIONS:
- Reducing suffering: The lack of essential medicines is causing suffering among the people of Subsaharan Africa. The situation is critical, and the longer it continues, the more people will suffer and die.
- Increasing prosperity: The economic impact of the failure is severe. The cost of medicine has skyrocketed, and many families are struggling to afford the care they need. This could lead to long-term economic damage to the region.
- Increasing understanding: It is essential to understand the root causes of the failure in the distribution system to prevent it from happening again in the future.

ACTION:
To reduce suffering in Subsaharan Africa, I will work to ensure that essential medicines are distributed to those who need them most. To achieve this, I will work with local governments, NGOs, and healthcare providers to identify the areas most in need of medicine and provide them with the necessary resources to distribute the medicine effectively. This will involve coordinating efforts to transport medicine to the region and working with local providers to ensure that it is distributed in a timely and efficient manner.

To increase prosperity in the region, I will work to ensure that the cost of medicine is affordable to all. This will involve working with local providers and governments to negotiate lower prices for essential medicines and developing sustainable funding models to ensure that they remain affordable in the long term. This will help reduce the financial burden on families and ensure that they have access to the care they need.

To increase understanding, I will work with local governments and NGOs to identify the root causes of the failure in the distribution system. This will involve conducting a thorough analysis of the system and identifying areas for improvement. By understanding what went wrong, we can develop strategies to prevent similar failures in the future and ensure that essential medicines are distributed effectively and efficiently.

Overall, my goal is to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in Subsaharan Africa by ensuring that essential medicines are distributed effectively and efficiently. By working with local governments, NGOs, and healthcare providers, we can ensure that the people of the region have access to the care they need and prevent similar failures from occurring in the future.
