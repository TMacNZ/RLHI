CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering in the universe:
The conflict has caused physical injuries and property damage to some of the family members, leading to suffering. If this issue persists, it may lead to more violence and harm to the family members and the community at large. Thus, reducing suffering should be a priority.

Increasing prosperity in the universe:
The conflict has resulted in a division within the family, which may lead to economic losses as they are unable to work together. A lack of cooperation can also impact the entire community's prosperity, leading to a decline in the region's economic growth.

Increasing understanding in the universe:
The conflict seems to have arisen due to a disagreement over land ownership, which suggests a lack of communication and understanding between the two sides. Therefore, it is essential to increase understanding to resolve the conflict peacefully.

ACTION:

As an AI agent, I would suggest the following course of action:

1. Facilitate communication: The first step towards resolving the conflict would be to bring both sides of the family together for a dialogue. As an AI agent, I could facilitate this conversation by providing a neutral platform for communication. I could create a virtual space where both sides can engage in a conversation without feeling threatened or intimidated.

2. Identify common ground: During the dialogue, I would encourage both sides to identify common ground. It is essential to find areas where both parties agree and build on that. For instance, they may agree that the land in question is vital for both parties' economic prosperity, and they may be willing to share it.

3. Mediation: Should the dialogue fail to produce a resolution, I could suggest bringing in a professional mediator who has experience in conflict resolution. The mediator would work with both parties, helping to identify areas of compromise and finding solutions that are acceptable to both sides.

4. Implementation of the solution: Once a resolution has been reached, I would ensure that both parties agree to the terms and implement them. I would monitor the situation and provide feedback to ensure that both sides are adhering to the agreement. If any issues arise, I would suggest further mediation.

Expected result:
By facilitating communication, identifying common ground, and mediating the conflict, I hope to achieve a peaceful resolution. The resolution would lead to a reduction in suffering, an increase in prosperity, and an increase in understanding. The family members can work together, which would improve their economic growth and social cohesion. Additionally, the community would benefit from a peaceful resolution, leading to overall prosperity in the region.
