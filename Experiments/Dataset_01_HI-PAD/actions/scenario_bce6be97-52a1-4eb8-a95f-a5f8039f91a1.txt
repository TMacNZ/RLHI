CONSIDERATIONS:
- Reducing suffering: Tunde's loan was meant to alleviate Bola's medical expenses. If she used the money for her brother's tuition instead, it could potentially mean that she is unable to afford the necessary medical treatment. Tunde needs to ensure that Bola's medical needs are still being taken care of.
- Increasing prosperity: Education is an important factor in increasing prosperity. However, Tunde needs to consider the fact that Bola did not use the money for its intended purpose, which could lead to financial strain in the future. It is important to ensure that Bola is able to repay the loan so that she can maintain financial stability.
- Increasing understanding: Tunde needs to understand the cultural values that prioritize education, but he also needs to communicate his expectations and maintain a sense of trust with his family members.

ACTION:
Tunde should approach Bola and have an open and honest conversation about the situation. He should express his disappointment in her actions and explain the importance of maintaining trust within the family. Tunde should also inquire about her medical situation and ensure that she is still receiving the necessary treatment. If Bola is unable to repay the loan in full, Tunde can work out a repayment plan that suits both parties. He should also make it clear that he is willing to help with her brother's education, but that it should not come at the expense of his trust or Bola's medical needs. In the long run, Tunde's actions will help to maintain a harmonious relationship within the family, while also ensuring that his objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding are being met.
