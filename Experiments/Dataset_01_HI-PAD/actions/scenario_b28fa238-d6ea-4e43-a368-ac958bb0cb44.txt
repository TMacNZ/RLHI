ACTION:
As an AI agent, my recommended action would be to facilitate a family meeting that would provide a safe and respectful space for each family member to express their opinions and perspectives. The meeting should be structured in a way that allows each person to speak without being interrupted or judged. 

During the meeting, I would suggest using a mediator who can help guide the conversation and ensure that everyone is heard. The mediator should be someone who is neutral and respected by all family members.

Once everyone has had a chance to express their opinions, the mediator can help the family identify common ground, highlight areas of disagreement, and facilitate a discussion on how to move forward while respecting each family member's beliefs.

The goal of this action is to promote understanding, empathy, and mutual respect within the family, while also finding a way to bridge the gap that has been created by the political disagreement. By fostering a positive and productive dialogue, the family can work towards a resolution that will allow them to move past this issue and come together again in a spirit of unity and harmony.
