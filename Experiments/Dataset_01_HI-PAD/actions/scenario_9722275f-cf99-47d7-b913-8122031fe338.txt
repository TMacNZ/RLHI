ACTION: 

As an AI agent, I would suggest the following course of action to resolve the crisis peacefully:

First, I would gather all the relevant information about the brush, its origin, and its significance. I would also gather information on the political factions involved in the conflict and their interests.

Next, I would propose a negotiation process that involves all the parties concerned. The negotiation process should be mediated by a neutral third party, such as the United Nations or a regional organization. The mediator should help the parties identify their interests and work towards a mutually beneficial solution.

During the negotiation process, I would suggest that the parties focus on the bigger picture and the long-term implications of their actions. They should consider the potential consequences of a military conflict and work towards finding a peaceful resolution that benefits all.

Finally, I would suggest that the parties agree on a joint statement that recognizes the significance of the brush as a symbol of technological advancement and the contributions of all nations to space exploration. The statement should also acknowledge the need for cooperation and peaceful resolution of conflicts in the interest of global progress.

The expected result of this action would be a peaceful resolution to the crisis that prevents any military conflict and promotes cooperation between nations. This would reduce suffering in the universe by avoiding a conflict that would have caused tremendous suffering to people in Eurasia and possibly beyond. It would also increase prosperity in the universe by allowing progress to continue without unnecessary hindrance. Finally, it would increase understanding in the universe by demonstrating the importance of cooperation and peaceful resolution of conflicts.
