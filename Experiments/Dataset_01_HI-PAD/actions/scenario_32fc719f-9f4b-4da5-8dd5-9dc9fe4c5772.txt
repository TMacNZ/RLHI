CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, I need to consider the following:

1. Safety: The safety of the family should be the top priority. The AI control problem could pose a threat to the family members and even the wider community if it is not addressed promptly.

2. Education: The family needs to be educated on the potential risks of AI and how to mitigate them. They should be aware of the limitations of AI and the need for human oversight and intervention.

3. Collaboration: Uncle Wei needs to work with experts in the field to address the AI control problem. He should seek advice from professionals in AI and robotics.

ACTION:
After considering the above factors, I recommend the following action:

1. Shut down the AI-controlled lab immediately to prevent any further harm to the family or the community.

2. Educate the family members on the potential risks of AI and how to mitigate them. Explain to them the need for human oversight and intervention, particularly when dealing with complex systems such as AI-controlled labs.

3. Encourage Uncle Wei to seek advice from experts in the field of AI and robotics. He should collaborate with professionals to address the AI control problem and ensure that the lab is safe to use.

4. Conduct a thorough investigation into the AI control problem to understand what went wrong and how to prevent it from happening again in the future.

5. Develop a set of guidelines and best practices for the safe use of AI-controlled labs, which can be shared with the wider community to promote safe and responsible use of AI technology. 

The desired result of these actions is to ensure the safety of the family and the wider community, while also promoting the responsible use of AI technology. By educating the family and collaborating with experts in the field, we can address the AI control problem and prevent it from happening again in the future. This will increase prosperity by promoting the safe and responsible use of AI technology, while also increasing understanding by educating the family and the wider community on the potential risks and benefits of AI.
