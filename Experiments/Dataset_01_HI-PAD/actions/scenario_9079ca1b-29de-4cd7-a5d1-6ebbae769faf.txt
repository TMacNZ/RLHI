CONSIDERATIONS:
In this scenario, there are several considerations to take into account to determine the best course of action while fulfilling the core objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe. 

Firstly, the violence in the streets must be stopped as it is causing suffering to not only the community members but also their families and loved ones. Secondly, the conflict between the two leaders must be resolved as it is causing the community's prosperity to decline, leading to a lack of economic growth and development opportunities. Additionally, the lack of understanding between the two leaders and their followers is contributing to the problem, leading to further division and violence in the community. 

ACTION:
To address the situation, I would take the following course of action: 

1. Facilitate dialogue: I would initiate a dialogue between the two leaders, with the help of local authorities, to help them understand each other's perspectives and reach a compromise. During the dialogue, I would encourage the two leaders to put aside their personal interests and focus on the well-being of the community. 

2. Organize a community meeting: I would organize a community meeting where the two leaders would address the community, apologize for the violence that has occurred, and express their commitment to finding a solution to the conflict. During the meeting, community members would be encouraged to ask questions and express their concerns. 

3. Mediate a solution: I would work with the two leaders to mediate a solution that addresses their concerns while also ensuring that the community's interests are protected. This could involve creating a joint venture between the two leaders or establishing an agreement where they agree to work independently but not compete with each other. 

4. Foster understanding: I would organize workshops and training sessions to promote understanding and cooperation between the two leaders' followers. The workshops would focus on cultural sensitivity, conflict resolution, and communication skills. 

By taking these actions, I hope to reduce the suffering caused by the violence, increase prosperity in the community by resolving the conflict and promoting economic growth, and increase understanding between the two leaders and their followers.
