CONSIDERATIONS:
To reduce suffering in the universe, it is essential to address the underlying causes of the political unrest in Subsaharan Africa. The conflict is rooted in the cultural differences among the different ethnic groups in the region. Therefore, it is necessary to promote mutual respect and understanding among the different cultural groups to achieve lasting peace. Additionally, it is vital to address the immediate humanitarian needs of the affected populations, such as providing shelter, food, and medical assistance. 

To increase prosperity in the universe, it is necessary to stabilize the region by promoting economic development and investment. However, this cannot be achieved without first addressing the political instability and cultural conflict in the region. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize peace and stability to attract investment and promote economic growth.

To increase understanding in the universe, it is essential to promote intercultural dialogue and understanding to bridge the cultural divide in the region. This can be achieved through education, cultural exchange programs, and community engagement.
