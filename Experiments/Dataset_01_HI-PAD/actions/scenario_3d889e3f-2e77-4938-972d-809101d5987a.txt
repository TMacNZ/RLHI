CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objective to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe, I would need to consider the following points in response to the scenario:
1. The pandemic has had a severe impact on the tourism industry, which is the primary source of income for Tiki Bay.
2. The financial crisis has put the local educational domain in jeopardy, which will have long-term implications for the community's future.
3. The community leaders are already brainstorming ideas to generate income and support educational programs.
4. Innovative solutions are required to revive the local economy and ensure that the children of Tiki Bay have access to quality education.

ACTION:
Given the above considerations, I would recommend the following action plan:
1. Collaboration with global organizations: Tiki Bay could collaborate with global organizations to develop a sustainable tourism model that is less reliant on international travel, promoting domestic and regional tourism. This would not only create jobs but also generate income for the community.
2. Promoting online education: With the pandemic, online education has become increasingly popular. Tiki Bay could invest in technology and promote online educational programs, which would allow children to access quality education from the comfort of their homes.
3. Developing alternative revenue streams: Tiki Bay could explore alternative revenue streams, such as developing local industries like agriculture or handicrafts, which could generate income and create employment opportunities.
4. Awareness campaigns: The community could launch awareness campaigns to attract visitors to the island and promote eco-tourism, which would not only help the community generate income but also protect the island's natural resources.

The above actions could be carried out by the local government and community leaders, with support from global organizations and the private sector. The expected result would be a revived local economy, access to quality education for the children of Tiki Bay, and a sustainable tourism model that prioritizes the island's natural resources and cultural heritage.
