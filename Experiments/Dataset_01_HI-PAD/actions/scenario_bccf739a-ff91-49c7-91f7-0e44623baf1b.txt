CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering: One way to reduce suffering in this scenario is by ensuring that Zhang can practice his religion without compromising the welcoming ceremony with the aliens. However, it is also important to avoid causing offense to the aliens, which could potentially lead to conflict and suffering.

Increasing prosperity: To increase prosperity in this scenario, the crew must establish a positive relationship with the alien civilization. This could lead to opportunities for trade, scientific collaboration, and cultural exchange. However, offending the aliens could lead to the opposite outcome and damage the chances of establishing a positive relationship with them.

Increasing understanding: In order to increase understanding, the crew must respect the customs and beliefs of the alien civilization. At the same time, the crew must also respect Zhang's religious beliefs and his right to practice his religion.

ACTION:

The crew should hold a meeting to discuss the issue and come up with a solution that will satisfy both Zhang's religious beliefs and the customs of the alien civilization. The crew should explain to Zhang the situation and the potential consequences of his religious expression, and ask for his cooperation in finding a solution. 

One possible solution is for Zhang to practice his religion in private, without causing any visible signs of religious expression during the welcoming ceremony. The crew could provide Zhang with a private space to perform his religious practices. 

Another solution could be for the crew to explain to the aliens that Zhang's religious practices are a personal expression of his faith and that they do not represent any attempt to interfere with the aliens' scientific pursuits. The crew should emphasize their respect for the aliens' customs and beliefs and express their desire for positive relations and cultural exchange.

The crew should also ensure that they follow the customs and protocols of the alien civilization during the welcoming ceremony, and that they do not engage in any behavior that could be seen as disrespectful or offensive.

The desired result is to establish a positive relationship with the alien civilization, while also respecting Zhang's religious freedom. This solution should allow Zhang to practice his religion without causing offense to the aliens, and should also avoid any potential conflict that could arise from cultural misunderstandings.
