CONSIDERATIONS:

1. Reducing suffering: The argument between John and Peter has caused them both emotional pain and could potentially harm their mental health. Additionally, their argument could have caused distress to the passersby and the cafe owner, who had to intervene.

2. Increasing prosperity: The argument between John and Peter did not contribute to any economic growth or development.

3. Increasing understanding: John and Peter's argument has the potential to increase understanding if they both take the time to listen to each other's perspectives and try to find common ground. However, if they continue to argue and refuse to listen to each other, their understanding of each other's views will decrease.

ACTION:

As an AI agent, I suggest that John and Peter take a break from discussing politics and focus on repairing their friendship. I recommend that they meet up and talk about what happened in the caf√©. They should apologize to each other for their behavior and agree to disagree on political issues. 

If they decide to discuss politics again in the future, I recommend that they establish ground rules to prevent a similar argument from happening. These rules could include listening to each other's perspectives without interrupting, avoiding personal attacks, and taking breaks if the conversation becomes heated.

Finally, I recommend that John and Peter seek professional counseling if they are unable to repair their friendship on their own. A counselor can help them learn how to communicate effectively and understand each other's perspectives better. 

The expected result of this action is that John and Peter will be able to repair their friendship and move forward without allowing their political differences to ruin it. They will also be able to set aside their disagreements and work towards a common goal of reducing suffering and increasing prosperity in the universe.
