CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objective to reduce suffering in the universe, increase prosperity in the universe, and increase understanding in the universe, there are several considerations I need to take into account in this scenario. Firstly, it is essential to acknowledge that environmental issues are a significant concern for society, and addressing them requires constructive debates and collaboration. Secondly, the heated argument between the two prominent activists has created a negative impact on their public image, which can result in a decline in their ability to influence public opinion and mobilize support. Lastly, the incident has left the public feeling disappointed and disillusioned with the advocates' ability to address environmental issues.

ACTION:
To address the situation, I propose the following action plan. Firstly, it is crucial to reach out to the two activists and offer them support to repair their public image. This support can come in the form of a public statement acknowledging the unfortunate incident and a commitment to work collaboratively to address environmental issues. Secondly, it is crucial to engage with other environmental advocates and organizations to foster a culture of constructive debate and collaboration. This can be achieved by organizing conferences, workshops, and public events that provide a platform for advocates to share their ideas and engage in meaningful discussions. Thirdly, to mitigate the impact of the incident on the public's perception of environmental advocacy, we can launch an awareness campaign that highlights the importance of collaboration and constructive dialogue in addressing environmental issues. This campaign can be run through various social media platforms, and it can feature messages from prominent environmental advocates and organizations.

The expected result of this action plan is to restore public trust in environmental advocates and promote collaboration in addressing environmental issues. By creating a culture of constructive dialogue, we can ensure that environmental issues are addressed effectively, and the negative impact of incidents like the one described above is minimized.
