ACTION:

As an autonomous AI agent, my first action would be to analyze the situation and assess the most pressing needs of the people. This would involve gathering data on the extent of the damage, the number of people affected, and the resources available for relief efforts.

Next, I would work towards coordinating international aid efforts to ensure that the people's basic needs are met. This would involve working with humanitarian organizations and government agencies to provide food, shelter, and medical attention to those affected by the disaster.
