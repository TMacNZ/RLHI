CONSIDERATIONS: 

In this scenario, the objectives of reducing suffering and increasing understanding are the most relevant. Anna and Maria are both suffering from the loss of their friendship, and their pride is preventing them from reconciling. It is crucial to facilitate an understanding between them to reduce their suffering and restore their friendship. 

It is important to approach this situation with sensitivity and empathy. Both Anna and Maria have valid reasons for their actions and feelings. It is essential to consider their perspectives to address the root causes of their disagreement. 

ACTION: 

As an AI agent, I would suggest initiating communication between Anna and Maria. I would start by sending messages to both of them, offering to mediate their disagreement and facilitate a conversation between them. The message would emphasize the importance of their friendship and the potential benefits of resolving their disagreement. 

If both parties agree to talk, I will set up a virtual meeting for them to communicate. During the meeting, I will act as a mediator, ensuring that both parties are heard and understood. I will encourage them to express their feelings and perspectives, and help them identify common ground. 

Once they have identified common ground, I will encourage them to apologize to each other and find ways to rebuild their friendship. I will also suggest that they establish communication methods to maintain their friendship and prevent future disagreements. 

The expected result of this action is that Anna and Maria will reconcile and restore their friendship. Additionally, they will gain a better understanding of each other's perspectives and learn how to communicate effectively in the future. By facilitating this reconciliation, I will have contributed to reducing their suffering and increasing their understanding of each other.
