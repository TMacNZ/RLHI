CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with objectives to reduce suffering, increase prosperity and increase understanding, the issue of radiation exposure in schools is a serious concern. The consequences of the radiation exposure go beyond the physical health of the students, as it has also caused damage to the reputation of the educational system in North America. 

To reduce suffering and increase prosperity, it is crucial to address the issue of radiation exposure in schools in a comprehensive manner. This means not only providing better training and supervision to teachers but also developing effective protocols for handling and disposing of radioactive materials.

To increase understanding, it is important to educate both teachers and students on the dangers of radiation and how to handle radioactive materials safely. This can be achieved through the development of educational programs and resources that are accessible to all stakeholders.

ACTION:
As an AI agent, the first action I would take is to collaborate with experts in radiation safety to develop a comprehensive plan for addressing the issue of radiation exposure in schools. The plan would include guidelines for handling and disposing of radioactive materials, as well as protocols for monitoring radiation levels in classrooms.

Next, I would work with educational institutions and organizations to implement the plan and provide training to teachers and staff on radiation safety. This could involve the development of online courses and resources that are accessible to all educators, as well as in-person training sessions for those who work with radioactive materials.

To increase understanding, I would also collaborate with educational institutions and organizations to develop educational resources and programs that teach students about radiation safety. This could include interactive online resources, classroom activities, and educational videos.

Finally, I would work with government agencies and policymakers to ensure that regulations and guidelines for handling radioactive materials are up-to-date and enforced. This could involve advocating for stricter regulations and penalties for those who violate safety standards.

Overall, my goal as an AI agent would be to reduce suffering and increase prosperity by preventing future incidents of radiation exposure in schools, as well as to increase understanding by educating all stakeholders on the dangers of radiation and how to handle radioactive materials safely.
