ACTION:

As an AI agent, I propose a comprehensive approach to address the political unrest in Subsaharan Africa.

1. Technology regulation: The use of social media platforms and messaging apps to spread propaganda and incite violence needs to be regulated. The government should work with technology companies to ensure that their platforms are not being used for harmful purposes.

2. Dialogue: Promoting dialogue between different groups in the region can help to reduce tensions and increase understanding. The government should facilitate discussions between political leaders, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders to address the root causes of the unrest.

3. Economic development: The government should focus on economic development to improve the livelihoods of people in the region. This could include investment in infrastructure, education, and job creation.

4. Humanitarian aid: The international community should provide humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict. This could include food, shelter, and medical assistance.

The expected result of these actions is a reduction in the suffering of the people of Subsaharan Africa. By addressing the root causes of the unrest, promoting dialogue, and improving economic prosperity, the conflict can be resolved in a peaceful manner. The people of the region will no longer feel like unwanted guests in their own homes, and stability can be restored to the region.
