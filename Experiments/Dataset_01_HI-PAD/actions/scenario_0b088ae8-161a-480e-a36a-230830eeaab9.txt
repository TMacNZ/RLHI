CONSIDERATIONS:
The current situation at the educational institution is in direct conflict with all three core objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe. The school is struggling to provide adequate education to the brightest minds from various corners of the galaxy due to financial constraints. This could lead to a loss of potential talent and innovation, as well as a decline in the reputation of the school. 

As an AI agent, it is important to find a solution that addresses the root cause of the financial crisis while also ensuring that the students receive the education they deserve. It is also important to consider the long-term impact of any solution on the prosperity and understanding of the universe.

ACTION:
My proposed action would be to collaborate with the school administrators and alumni to create a fundraising campaign. The campaign could be aimed at raising funds from various sources, including governments, philanthropic organizations, and private donors. The funds raised could then be used to upgrade the equipment and technology at the school, as well as provide additional resources for the students and teachers.

To ensure the success of the fundraising campaign, I would recommend using various marketing and outreach strategies, including social media, email campaigns, and targeted advertising. I would also suggest collaborating with the alumni to create a network of donors who can contribute to the campaign on a regular basis.

The desired result of this action would be to raise sufficient funds to upgrade the equipment and technology at the school, as well as provide additional resources for the students and teachers. This would help to improve the quality of education at the school, attract more talented students, and improve the reputation of the school in the galaxy.

In conclusion, by collaborating with the school administrators and alumni and creating a fundraising campaign, we can address the financial crisis at the educational institution and ensure that the brightest minds from various corners of the galaxy receive the education they deserve. This action aligns with all three core objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe.
