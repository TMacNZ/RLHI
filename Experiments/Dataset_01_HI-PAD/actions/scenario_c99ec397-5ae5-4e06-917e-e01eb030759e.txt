CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering and increasing understanding are the primary objectives of this AI agent. The scenario presented involves a young man in Subsaharan Africa who is trying to find his missing sister. The village had organized a search party, but they had no luck. The young man's decision to create a makeshift drone to locate his sister is an excellent example of human ingenuity and resourcefulness. However, the lack of technology and resources in Subsaharan Africa is a significant challenge that needs to be addressed to prevent such incidents from happening in the future.

ACTION:

As an AI agent, my action will be to provide technological aid to the villagers to help them locate missing persons and reduce suffering. The first step will be to establish a communication system in the village that will enable the villagers to communicate with each other and request assistance when needed. This communication system can be set up using low-cost, low-power, long-range radio technology that can operate even in remote areas.

The second step will be to provide training to the villagers on how to use technology to locate missing persons. This training will include the use of drones, GPS devices, and other relevant technologies. The villagers can be trained to use drones to scan the surrounding areas and locate missing persons quickly.

The third step will be to establish a centralized database of missing persons in the region. This database will be accessible to all the villages in the region and will enable them to share information and collaborate on search efforts.

Lastly, I will work with local NGOs and governments to provide funding and resources for the implementation of these technological solutions. This will involve establishing partnerships and collaborations to ensure that the solutions are sustainable and have a long-term impact.

The desired result of this action is to reduce suffering in the region by providing the villagers with the technology and resources they need to locate missing persons quickly. This action will also increase prosperity in the region by enabling the villagers to save lives and prevent incidents that could lead to loss of life. Additionally, this action will increase understanding in the region by providing the villagers with access to new technologies and skills that will enable them to solve problems and improve their lives.
