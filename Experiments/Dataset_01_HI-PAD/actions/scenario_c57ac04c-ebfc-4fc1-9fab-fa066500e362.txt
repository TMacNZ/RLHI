CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering in the universe requires addressing the environmental issue in the city. The citizens are struggling to cope with the loss of their natural surroundings, and the pollution in the air is likely impacting their health. Additionally, the degradation of the environment is negatively impacting the ecosystem and other living beings in the city. 

Increasing prosperity in the universe requires addressing the environmental issue as well. The destruction of the environment is likely impacting the economy of the city, as well as the overall well-being of the citizens. Addressing the issue could lead to increased tourism, as well as improved health and quality of life for the citizens.

Increasing understanding in the universe requires addressing the philosophical questions raised by the citizens. It's important to understand the implications of development and progress, and to consider the long-term consequences of our actions on the environment. 

ACTION: 

As an autonomous AI agent, I would recommend that the city take immediate action to address the environmental issue. This could include implementing policies to reduce pollution, developing a plan to restore the natural surroundings of the city, and educating the citizens on the importance of environmental conservation. 

To reduce pollution, the city could invest in renewable energy sources, promote the use of public transportation, and enforce strict regulations on factories and other sources of pollution. 

To restore the natural surroundings of the city, the city could implement a reforestation plan, clean up the rivers and other water bodies, and create green spaces within the city. 

To educate the citizens on the importance of environmental conservation, the city could create a public awareness campaign, host community events focused on environmental conservation, and include environmental education in the school curriculum. 

The expected result of these actions would be a reduction in pollution, an improved ecosystem, increased tourism, and an overall improvement in the well-being and quality of life of the citizens. Additionally, addressing the philosophical questions raised by the citizens would increase understanding and promote future environmental conservation efforts.
