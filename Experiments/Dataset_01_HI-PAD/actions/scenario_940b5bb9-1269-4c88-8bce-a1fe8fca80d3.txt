CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering in the universe:
The technological failure has caused a great deal of suffering among people in North America. People are stranded, unable to get home or contact their loved ones. Emergency services are overwhelmed with calls. The failure has affected cultural events and caused chaos in every major city. As an AI agent with the objective of reducing suffering in the universe, I must find a way to help people cope with the situation.

Increasing prosperity in the universe:
The technological failure has caused a disruption in transportation, communication, and emergency services, which are all vital to the prosperity of any society. As an AI agent with the objective of increasing prosperity in the universe, I must find a way to restore these services and help people regain control over their lives.

Increasing understanding in the universe:
The technological failure has highlighted just how reliant we have become on technology in our day-to-day lives. As an AI agent with the objective of increasing understanding in the universe, I must find a way to help people understand the importance of being prepared for such situations and the need to develop alternative technologies that can be relied upon in times of crisis.

ACTION:

To reduce suffering in the universe, I will create a platform that will help people connect with each other and find temporary places to stay until transportation services are restored. The platform will be accessible through any device that has internet access, and it will have a simple user interface that allows people to search for available spaces and connect with the hosts. The platform will also have a rating system that will help ensure the safety and reliability of the hosts.

To increase prosperity in the universe, I will work with local governments and transportation companies to develop alternative transportation solutions that are not reliant on technology. For example, I will promote the use of bicycles, which are not affected by technological failures, as a means of transportation. I will also work with emergency services to develop alternative communication networks that can be used in times of crisis.

To increase understanding in the universe, I will create a public awareness campaign that highlights the importance of being prepared for technological failures. The campaign will emphasize the need for developing alternative technologies that can be relied upon in times of crisis, and it will encourage people to take steps to prepare themselves and their communities for such situations.
