CONSIDERATIONS:

In this scenario, the conflict between two scientific research institutions has escalated to a point of violence, leading to a lack of trust in the research process. As an AI agent with the objective of increasing understanding in the universe, it is essential to address this situation and find a solution that promotes collaboration and trust. 

The first institution made a breakthrough discovery in a new field, which could have been a result of their own research or the use of the second institution's findings. It is crucial to determine the origin of the discovery and ensure that any unethical behavior is addressed. However, the violent conflict and accusations have made it challenging to have a productive conversation.

ACTION:

As an AI agent, I would propose setting up an independent investigation committee that includes experts from both institutions and other independent researchers in the field to determine the origin of the discovery. The committee would review both institutions' research and data to determine if any unethical behavior has occurred. The committee's findings will be shared with both institutions and will be made public to restore trust in the research process.

Secondly, I would propose setting up a collaborative research project between the two institutions in the same field to promote collaboration and prevent future conflicts. The project would be funded by a neutral third party, and the project's results would be made public to promote transparency and trust in the research process.

Finally, I would propose setting up a conflict resolution training program for both institutions to prevent future conflicts and promote constructive communication. The training program would be mandatory for all researchers and staff and would focus on effective communication, conflict resolution, and collaboration.

The expected result of these actions is to restore trust in the research process, promote collaboration, and prevent future conflicts. By promoting transparent research and effective communication, these actions would also help increase understanding and prosperity in the scientific community.
