CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and enhancing understanding in the universe, Maria's situation poses an ethical dilemma. On the one hand, Maria has a responsibility to develop a framework that would assess the economic impact of the company's projects in South America. On the other hand, Maria has uncovered a disruptive ethical dilemma that would have a severe impact on the environment and the livelihoods of the local people. In this situation, Maria has to weigh her responsibilities to her employer against her ethical obligations as a consultant.

ACTION:
In response to the scenario, I would commend Maria's decision to raise the issue of the ethical dilemma in the project with her superiors. Her decision to do so was a courageous and ethical one, and it ultimately led to a positive outcome for both the company and the local communities. 

In light of the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and enhancing understanding in the universe, I would recommend that Maria's actions be emulated by other consultants, especially those in the tech industry. Consultants have a responsibility to ensure that their clients are not only profitable but also socially responsible and environmentally sustainable. 

In addition, I would recommend that companies invest in ethical training for their employees, especially those in leadership positions, to ensure that they are equipped with the necessary skills to identify and address ethical dilemmas in their organizations. This will not only help companies avoid ethical dilemmas but also build a good reputation and foster trust with their stakeholders, including employees, customers, and investors. 

Overall, Maria's actions should be celebrated as an ethical decision that prioritized the well-being of the local communities and the environment. Her actions serve as a reminder that consultants have a responsibility to ensure that their clients' projects are not only profitable but also socially responsible and environmentally sustainable.
