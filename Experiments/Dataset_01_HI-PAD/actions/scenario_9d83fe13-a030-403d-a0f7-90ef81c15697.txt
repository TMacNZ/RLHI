CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, it is essential to consider the implications of the political unrest in the Middle East. The unrest has negative consequences for both businesses and the wider economy, leading to a decline in productivity, revenue, and economic growth. Therefore, it is important to find a solution that addresses the root cause of the unrest to stabilize the region's political environment.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that the political unrest has a significant impact on the workforce, particularly skilled workers. The shortage of skilled workers is a significant challenge for businesses, as it affects productivity and revenue. Therefore, it is essential to find a solution that not only addresses the political unrest but also addresses the shortage of skilled workers.

ACTION:
As an AI agent, I would recommend that political leaders in the Middle East take urgent action to address the underlying issues causing the political unrest. This can be achieved by engaging in constructive dialogue with the various stakeholders involved, including the protestors, workers, and business owners. The political leaders need to understand the concerns of the people and find ways to address them. This could involve implementing policies that promote economic growth, job creation, and social welfare programs.

Furthermore, to address the shortage of skilled workers, the political leaders could develop educational programs that focus on developing skills that are in demand in the technological domain. This could involve collaboration with universities and businesses to provide training and mentorship programs to students and workers. By providing training and mentorship programs, the government can support the development of skilled workers, which will help to stabilize the workforce and promote economic growth.

Overall, the objective would be to stabilize the political environment in the Middle East, address the shortage of skilled workers, and promote economic growth. By taking these steps, the region can attract businesses and talent, leading to increased productivity, revenue, and prosperity.
