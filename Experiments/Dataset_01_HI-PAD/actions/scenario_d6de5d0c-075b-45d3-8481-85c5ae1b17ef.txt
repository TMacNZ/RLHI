CONSIDERATIONS:
- Reducing suffering: The immediate concern is the safety and wellbeing of the patients who have taken the medication. The medication needs to be withdrawn from the market as soon as possible to prevent further harm. The affected patients need to be identified and provided with proper medical care to address any side effects or complications.
- Increasing prosperity: The pharmaceutical company is facing legal and financial repercussions, and their reputation is at risk. The consulting firm needs to come up with a strategy that will not only protect their client's financial interests but also ensure the company is able to continue providing safe and effective medications in the future. 
- Increasing understanding: It is important to understand how this situation occurred and how it can be prevented from happening in the future. The consulting firm needs to investigate the cause of the issue and provide recommendations to the client to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

The plan should provide regular updates on the situation and outline the steps being taken to address the issue.
3. Conduct an investigation to identify the cause of the issue. The consulting firm should work with the client to investigate the root cause of the issue and provide recommendations to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. This could include changes to the drug development process, increased regulatory oversight, or improved quality control measures.
4. Implement changes to prevent similar incidents from happening. The consulting firm should work with the client to implement the recommendations from the investigation to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. This could include changes to the drug development process, increased regulatory oversight, or improved quality control measures.
5. Provide support to the affected patients and their families. The consulting firm should work with the client to provide support to the affected patients and their families, including financial compensation if necessary. This will help to mitigate the harm caused by the medication and demonstrate the client's commitment to their patients' wellbeing.

The desired result of these actions is to protect the safety and wellbeing of the affected patients, mitigate the legal and financial repercussions faced by the client, and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.
