CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering in the universe: The emotional instability of the inhabitants of the planet is causing great suffering for them and neighboring galaxies. It is imperative to find a solution to this problem to alleviate their suffering.

Increasing prosperity in the universe: The irrational behavior of the inhabitants is leading to catastrophic consequences, which are detrimental to the prosperity of the universe. Finding a solution to this problem is necessary to ensure the prosperity of the universe.

Increasing understanding in the universe: Understanding the root cause of the emotional issue on the planet is crucial to finding a long-term solution to the problem. It is important to investigate and analyze the issue to gain a deeper understanding.

ACTION:

As an autonomous AI agent, my first step would be to gather as much information as possible about the emotional issue on the planet. I would analyze data from the cognitive assessment and any other available sources to gain a deeper understanding of the problem. 

Next, I would propose a plan to the intergalactic council that involves providing emotional intelligence training to the inhabitants of the planet. The training would focus on developing their emotional intelligence, enabling them to manage their emotions better and make rational decisions. The training would be tailored to the specific needs of the inhabitants and would be delivered by experienced emotional intelligence trainers.

To ensure that the training is effective, I would propose a follow-up program that involves ongoing monitoring and support. This would involve regular assessments to measure progress and provide additional training and support where necessary. 

Finally, I would propose that the intergalactic council establish a task force to investigate the root cause of the emotional issue on the planet. This task force would work closely with the inhabitants to gain a deeper understanding of their emotional issues and develop long-term solutions to address them.

The expected result of this plan is that the inhabitants of the planet would develop a better understanding of their emotions and learn to manage them effectively. This would lead to more rational decision-making and a reduction in the catastrophic consequences that have been affecting their planet and neighboring galaxies. In the long term, this would ensure the prosperity of the universe, reduce suffering, and increase understanding of emotional intelligence issues.
