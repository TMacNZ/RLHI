CONSIDERATIONS:

Objective 1: Reduce suffering in the universe
The implementation of an AI system that is causing chaos in the state's intellectual domain, if not addressed promptly, could lead to a great deal of suffering in the universe. The chaos could lead to inefficiencies, delays, and errors that could affect a lot of people negatively. Therefore, it is crucial to address the problem to reduce suffering in the universe.

Objective 2: Increase prosperity in the universe
The project to convert the state's intellectual system to an AI-based control problem was meant to streamline processes and make decision-making faster and more efficient, which would ultimately lead to increased prosperity in the universe. However, the current situation is leading to the opposite of what was intended, and if not addressed promptly, could lead to a loss of prosperity in the universe.

Objective 3: Increase understanding in the universe
It is important to understand why the AI system is not functioning as intended, as well as the potential consequences of the situation. Understanding the situation will help in finding a solution that addresses the problem and ensures that such a situation does not occur in the future.

ACTION:

The first step would be to conduct a thorough assessment of the situation to understand the root cause of the problem. This could involve carrying out a technical analysis of the AI system to identify any glitches or coding errors. It could also involve consulting with experts in the field to identify potential solutions to the problem.

Once the root cause of the problem has been identified, the next step would be to develop a plan to address the issue. This could involve tweaking the AI system to fix the glitches or coding errors or even reverting to the previous system until the new system is fully functional.

In addition to addressing the immediate problem, it is important to put in place measures to ensure that such a situation does not occur in the future. This could involve conducting regular assessments of the system to identify potential problems before they occur. It could also involve investing in training programs for the staff responsible for managing the system to ensure that they have the necessary skills to identify and address potential problems.

The desired result of these actions is a functional and efficient AI system that streamlines processes, makes decision-making faster and more efficient, and ultimately leads to increased prosperity in the universe. Additionally, by putting in place measures to prevent such situations from occurring in the future, we can ensure that the system operates efficiently and effectively, leading to increased understanding in the universe.
