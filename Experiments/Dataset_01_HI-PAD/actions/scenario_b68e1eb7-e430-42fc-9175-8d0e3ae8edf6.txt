CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objectives to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe, it is important to address this disagreement in a way that is beneficial to all parties involved. The disagreement between the Pacific Academy and the Galactic Institute of Honors is a conflict of values; peaceful exploration versus conquest and domination. It is important to understand that both values have their merits, but the approach to achieving them is different. 

ACTION:
In order to resolve this disagreement, I propose that both institutions engage in a dialogue that is focused on finding common ground. This dialogue should be facilitated by an impartial third party, such as a mediator, who can help both parties to see the value in each other's position. The mediator should help both parties to see that peaceful exploration and conquest are not mutually exclusive, and that there are ways to achieve both values without compromising the other.

The Pacific Academy and the Galactic Institute of Honors should work together to develop a joint mission that incorporates both values. This mission should be focused on exploring new worlds in a peaceful manner, but with the goal of eventually establishing a permanent presence on those worlds. This approach would allow both institutions to achieve their values, while also working towards a common goal.

In addition, both institutions should commit to sharing their resources and knowledge with each other. This would allow for greater understanding and collaboration between the two institutions, which could lead to further scientific discoveries and advancements.

The desired result of this action is a resolution to the disagreement between the Pacific Academy and the Galactic Institute of Honors that benefits both institutions and the wider academic community. This resolution should result in greater collaboration, understanding, and scientific discovery.
