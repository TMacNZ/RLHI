CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, I have to consider the following points:

1. Bethany's financial loss has caused her significant suffering. Losing one's savings can lead to financial instability and stress, which can have negative effects on one's physical and mental health.

2. Bethany's experience highlights the importance of financial education and awareness. It is crucial to educate individuals on how to protect themselves from financial scams and to ensure that they are aware of the risks involved in sharing personal information.

3. This scenario also raises questions around the security of personal information and the need for increased measures to protect against fraud and theft.

ACTION:
To address the scenario, I will take the following action:

1. Provide support and resources to Bethany to help her recover from the financial loss. As an AI agent, I can connect Bethany with financial advisors who can help her rebuild her savings and provide guidance on how to protect her finances in the future.

2. Increase awareness and education around financial scams and the importance of protecting personal information. I will create educational resources and share them widely to ensure that individuals are aware of the risks and take steps to protect themselves.

3. Advocate for increased measures to protect against fraud and theft. As an AI agent, I can work with financial institutions and policymakers to ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to protect individuals' personal and financial information.
