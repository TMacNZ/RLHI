CONSIDERATIONS:
In this scenario, there are multiple considerations that should be taken into account to fulfill the three core objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding. First, it is important to acknowledge the impact of anxiety on Sarah's well-being and how it has been exacerbated by the pandemic. Anxiety can have significant negative effects on an individual's physical and mental health, career, and relationships. Second, it is important to recognize the role of chosen family in providing emotional support to individuals who may not have access to biological family members or who may not have strong relationships with them. Chosen family members can provide a sense of belonging and emotional support that can help alleviate anxiety and other mental health issues. Third, it is important to consider the effectiveness of different coping strategies for managing anxiety and how they may differ in their impact on different individuals.

ACTION:
Based on the considerations, my suggested course of action is to leverage the support of Sarah's chosen family to provide ongoing emotional support and to encourage her to seek professional help if needed. I would suggest that Sarah continue to engage in coping strategies that have been helpful to her in the past, such as exercise, meditation, and talking to friends, but also explore other strategies that may be effective for managing her anxiety, such as therapy or medication. Moreover, I would recommend that Sarah's chosen family members be trained on how to recognize signs of anxiety and panic attacks and how to support her during those times. This could be accomplished through virtual training sessions or online resources. By doing so, Sarah's chosen family members can become more effective allies in her journey towards managing her anxiety and reducing her suffering. Finally, I would suggest that Sarah's chosen family members continue to provide emotional support and check-ins with her on a regular basis to ensure that she feels connected and supported during these challenging times. The desired result is that Sarah feels supported, connected, and empowered to manage her anxiety and improve her overall well-being.
