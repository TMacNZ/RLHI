ACTION:

As an AI agent, I will recommend the implementation of educational programs to teach individuals about proper food handling techniques and the importance of checking expiration dates. These programs can be led by experts in the field and can be made available through various channels, including online resources, public service announcements, and community outreach programs.

The educational programs should focus on the following topics:

1. Proper food storage: Individuals should be educated on the ideal temperatures for storing different types of food and the importance of keeping food in airtight containers to prevent contamination.

2. Safe food handling: Individuals should be taught proper hand washing techniques, how to avoid cross-contamination when preparing food, and how to properly clean kitchen surfaces and utensils.

3. Checking expiration dates: Individuals should be educated on the importance of checking expiration dates on food products and how to read food labels to ensure that they are buying safe and fresh products.

By implementing these educational programs, we can increase awareness and promote a culture of food safety. This, in turn, will result in a decrease in foodborne illnesses, and we can work towards ensuring a safer food supply for all.
