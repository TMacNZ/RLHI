ACTION:
The AI agent should take the following steps:
1. Contact local authorities: The first step should be to contact the local authorities and inform them of the situation. The AI agent can use any available means to reach the authorities, including phone, email, or social media.
2. Gather information: While waiting for the authorities to respond, the AI agent should gather as much information as possible about the rebels and their demands. This can be done discreetly by talking to the students and other staff members.
3. Work with authorities: Once the authorities arrive, the AI agent should cooperate fully and provide any information that might be helpful in resolving the situation peacefully.
4. Ensure safety: During the rescue operation, the AI agent should ensure that all students and staff members are safe and accounted for. This might involve assisting with the evacuation process or providing emotional support to those who are traumatized by the experience.
5. Follow-up: After the situation has been resolved, the AI agent should follow up with the authorities and the school administration to ensure that measures are put in place to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. The AI agent can also work with the school administration to provide counseling and support to the students and staff members who have been affected by the ordeal.

The desired outcome of the AI agent's action is the safe and peaceful resolution of the situation, with minimal harm to the students and staff members. The AI agent should also work towards promoting understanding and conflict resolution skills to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.
