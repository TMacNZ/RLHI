CONSIDERATIONS: 

Reducing suffering in Subsaharan Africa will require addressing the lack of access to proper medical tools. The shortage of essential tools has created many challenges for healthcare workers, leading to preventable deaths and illnesses. The lack of trust in the healthcare system due to the unavailability of essential tools has also resulted in reluctance to seek medical care, which can further exacerbate health issues in the region. 

Increasing prosperity in Subsaharan Africa will require addressing the shortage of essential medical tools. The lack of access to proper medical tools undermines the region's healthcare system, impacting both patients and healthcare workers. By providing the necessary tools, healthcare workers can provide better care to their patients, helping to improve overall health outcomes in the region. 

Increasing understanding in Subsaharan Africa will also require addressing the lack of access to proper medical tools. The lack of essential medical tools can hinder research efforts and limit scientific advancements in the region. Addressing this issue will require understanding the root causes of the problem, such as funding and distribution challenges. 

ACTION: 

To address the shortage of essential medical tools in Subsaharan Africa, I will work to increase funding for medical facilities and ensure the distribution of necessary tools to healthcare workers. This can be done by partnering with local governments and non-profit organizations to provide funding and resources to medical facilities in the region. Additionally, working with medical supply companies to ensure the distribution of necessary tools to healthcare workers can help to improve the quality of care and build trust in the healthcare system. 

I will also work to increase awareness of the importance of proper medical tools in the region. This can be done through education and outreach efforts that highlight the impact of the shortage of essential tools on healthcare outcomes in Subsaharan Africa. By raising awareness and advocating for increased funding and resources, we can work towards reducing suffering and increasing prosperity and understanding in the region. 

The desired result of these actions is to improve the health outcomes of individuals and communities in Subsaharan Africa. By providing the necessary tools and resources, healthcare workers can provide better care to their patients, leading to a reduction in preventable deaths and illnesses. Additionally, building trust in the healthcare system can encourage individuals to seek medical care when needed, further improving health outcomes in the region. Finally, addressing the shortage of essential tools can help to promote scientific advancements and research efforts in the region, leading to further understanding and progress.
