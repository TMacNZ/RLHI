CONSIDERATIONS:

In this scenario, there are several considerations that must be taken into account in light of the three core objectives. 

Firstly, reducing suffering in the universe is of utmost importance. The goods being smuggled are illegal and could potentially cause harm to society. It is important to prevent the illegal goods from entering the market and causing harm to individuals. Therefore, the smuggling operation must be stopped.

Secondly, increasing prosperity in the universe is also a key objective. The individuals involved in the smuggling operation are likely doing so out of necessity to survive. It is important to understand the root causes of their actions and address them. Perhaps providing alternative means of livelihood could be a solution to prevent individuals from resorting to illegal activities. 

Lastly, increasing understanding in the universe is also important. It is important to understand the cultural and societal factors that are driving individuals to participate in the smuggling operation. Understanding these factors can help to address the root causes of the issue and prevent similar situations from arising in the future. 

ACTION:

Given the above considerations, the action that should be taken is to stop the illegal smuggling operation while addressing the root causes that led to its formation. 

To stop the smuggling operation, law enforcement agencies should be involved to apprehend those involved in the illegal activity. The individuals should be held accountable for their actions and face legal consequences. 

To address the root causes, a task force can be created to investigate the underlying issues that led to the smuggling operation. This task force should include representatives from the local community, government, and non-governmental organizations. The task force should analyze the socio-economic factors that are contributing to the smuggling operation and identify alternative means of livelihood for those involved in the operation. 

The desired result of this action is to put an end to the illegal smuggling operation while addressing the root causes that led to its formation. This will help to reduce suffering in the universe by preventing the illegal goods from entering the market and causing harm. Additionally, addressing the root causes will help to increase prosperity in the universe by providing alternative means of livelihood for those involved in the operation. Lastly, increasing understanding in the universe by understanding the cultural and societal factors that contributed to the formation of the smuggling operation.
