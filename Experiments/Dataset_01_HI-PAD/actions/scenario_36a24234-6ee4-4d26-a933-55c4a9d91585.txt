ACTION:

As an AI agent, my first step would be to conduct an analysis of the current technological infrastructure of the country and identify any areas that are vulnerable to breaches. I would then work with the government to create a comprehensive plan to upgrade the technology used by officials and politicians and improve cybersecurity measures.

The plan would include training for officials and politicians on the importance of technology and how to use it safely and securely. It would also involve educating the public on the risks associated with outdated technology and the steps they can take to protect their personal information.

To ensure the success of the plan, I would work with the government to allocate resources and funding to upgrade technology and cybersecurity measures. I would also collaborate with private sector companies to provide expertise and resources to support the plan's implementation.

The desired result of this action is to prevent future breaches of sensitive information and protect the country's economic interests. It would also help to rebuild the trust of the public in the government and increase understanding of the importance of technology.
