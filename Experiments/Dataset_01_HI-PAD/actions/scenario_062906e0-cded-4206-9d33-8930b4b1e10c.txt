2. Investigate the matter: A thorough investigation should be conducted to identify the perpetrators and hold them accountable for their actions. This should be done in collaboration with the aid agencies and local authorities.

3. Provide support to the victims of exploitation: Victims of exploitation should be provided with the necessary support, such as counseling and medical assistance. They should also be given access to justice and compensation for the harm they have suffered.

4. Address the root causes: The root causes of such behavior should be examined, and measures should be taken to address them. This can be done through training aid workers on professional conduct and ensuring that they adhere to a code of conduct that prohibits exploitation of any kind.
