CONSIDERATIONS:

Reduce suffering: The crew of the spaceship faced a life-threatening situation when their ship broke apart, and they had to abandon it. They were also put in danger when they encountered hostile alien creatures on the planet's surface. I must ensure that the crew receives the necessary support to recover from the trauma they experienced during the incident.

Increase prosperity: In a situation like this, it is essential to develop strategies that can help prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. I must analyze the cause of the spaceship's cover's failure and suggest ways to improve its design so that such incidents can be avoided in the future.

Increase understanding: The experience that Zara and her crew went through is valuable in terms of learning about the dangers of deep space exploration. I must gather data about the incident and use it to improve our understanding of the risks associated with space exploration.

ACTION:

To reduce suffering, I will provide the crew with access to mental health professionals who can help them cope with the trauma of their experience. I will also ensure that they receive any necessary medical attention to recover from the physical strain they endured during the incident.

To increase prosperity, I will analyze the data collected during the incident and suggest improvements to the design of the spaceship's cover. I will work with the engineering team to develop a more robust and durable cover that can withstand the harsh conditions of deep space.

To increase understanding, I will use the data collected during the incident to update our risk assessment protocols for deep space exploration. I will also use the incident as a case study to educate future space explorers about the potential dangers they may face and how to prepare for them.

The desired result of these actions is to ensure that future space exploration missions are safer and more successful. The crew of Zara's spaceship will also receive the necessary support to recover from their traumatic experience and continue to explore the universe with confidence.
