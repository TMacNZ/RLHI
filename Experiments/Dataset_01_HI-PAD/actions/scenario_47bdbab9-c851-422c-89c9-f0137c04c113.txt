CONSIDERATIONS:

In addressing this issue, there are a few considerations to keep in mind in light of the three core objectives:

1. Reducing suffering: The excessive use of plastic during traditional events and celebrations can cause harm to the environment and wildlife. It is important to find a way to reduce this harm to achieve this objective.

2. Increasing prosperity: The use of eco-friendly alternatives can stimulate the economy and create a market for sustainable products. Additionally, preserving the environment can lead to long-term economic benefits.

3. Increasing understanding: It is important to understand and respect cultural traditions, while also finding ways to adopt sustainable practices. Educating individuals on the impact of plastic waste and the benefits of eco-friendly alternatives can increase understanding.

ACTION:

To address this issue, I propose the following action:

1. Education campaign: Launch an education campaign to raise awareness on the impact of plastic waste and the benefits of eco-friendly alternatives. This campaign can target individuals, communities, and businesses.

2. Collaboration with businesses: Collaborate with businesses to promote the use of biodegradable products during traditional events and celebrations. This can include providing incentives for businesses that adopt sustainable practices.

3. Government regulation: Encourage the government to regulate the use of plastic during traditional events and celebrations. This can include providing tax breaks for businesses that use biodegradable products, as well as fines for those that continue to use plastic.

The expected result of this action is a reduction in plastic waste during traditional events and celebrations in the Middle East region. This will lead to a decrease in harm to the environment and wildlife, as well as a market for sustainable products, which can stimulate the economy. Additionally, an education campaign can increase understanding and respect for cultural traditions while also promoting sustainable practices.
