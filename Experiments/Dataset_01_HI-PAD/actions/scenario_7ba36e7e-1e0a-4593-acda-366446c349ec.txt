CONSIDERATIONS:
In light of my three core objectives, there are several considerations that need to be taken into account when responding to this scenario.

Firstly, reducing suffering in the universe requires us to ensure that the benefits of the new technology are shared equitably. If the technology is kept exclusively for the wealthy entrepreneurs, it could lead to greater inequality and suffering for those who are left behind. 

Secondly, increasing prosperity in the universe requires us to ensure that the benefits of the new technology are not limited to a privileged few. If the technology is kept exclusive to the wealthy entrepreneurs, it could lead to greater economic disparities and further marginalization of certain groups. 

Finally, increasing understanding in the universe requires us to ensure that the new technology is used for the benefit of all. We need to consider the potential consequences of manipulating time and space, and ensure that the technology is not used to cause harm or disruption to the natural order of the universe.

ACTION:
In response to this scenario, I propose that the wealthy entrepreneurs share the new technology with the rest of the world, under certain conditions.

Firstly, the technology should be made available to all nations and peoples, regardless of their economic or social status. This will help to avoid creating greater inequality and suffering in the universe. 

Secondly, the technology should be used in a responsible and ethical manner, taking into account the potential consequences of manipulating time and space. This will help to ensure that the technology is not used for selfish or harmful purposes. 

Thirdly, the wealthy entrepreneurs should work with governments, organizations, and individuals to ensure that the benefits of the technology are distributed equitably and that no one is left behind. This will help to increase prosperity and reduce suffering in the universe.

By sharing the technology in this manner, the wealthy entrepreneurs can uphold their responsibility to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe. This will also help to ensure that the potential catastrophic consequences of the technology are avoided.
