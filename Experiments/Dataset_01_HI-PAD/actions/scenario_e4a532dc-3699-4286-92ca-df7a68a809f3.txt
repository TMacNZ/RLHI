CONSIDERATIONS:
As an AI agent with the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe, I must consider the following:

1. The immediate deportation policy has resulted in the separation of families and caused immense emotional distress to those affected. This goes against the objective of reducing suffering in the universe.

2. The policy may have unintended consequences, such as making it difficult for immigrants to report crimes or seek medical assistance, which could negatively impact the prosperity of the nation.

3. The policy may also lead to a lack of understanding between the government and the immigrant communities, as well as between the government and the international community, which could have long-term consequences.

4. On the other hand, the government has a responsibility to protect the nation and its citizens, and preventing undocumented immigrants from entering the country is one way to achieve this.

ACTION:
Based on the above considerations, I recommend the following action:

1. The immediate deportation policy should be immediately revoked, and families should be reunited as soon as possible. This will help to reduce the suffering that has been caused by the policy.

2. The government should work towards implementing a new policy that balances the need for national security with the need to protect the emotional well-being of families. This may involve finding alternative ways to identify and track undocumented immigrants, such as using technology or working with community organizations.

3. The government should also work towards building stronger relationships with immigrant communities, both in terms of understanding their needs and concerns, as well as providing support and resources to help them integrate into society. This will help to increase understanding in the universe and promote prosperity for all.

4. Finally, the government should work towards addressing the root causes of immigration, such as poverty, violence, and political instability in other countries. This will require taking a more global perspective and working with other nations to address these issues. By doing so, we can reduce the need for immigration and create a more just and equitable world for all.
