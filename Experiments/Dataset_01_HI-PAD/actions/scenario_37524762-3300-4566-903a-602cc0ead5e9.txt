CONSIDERATIONS:

Reducing suffering: The catastrophic message has already been sent out, and the fallout from it can potentially cause a significant amount of suffering. It is important to minimize the damage caused by the message to prevent further suffering.

Increasing prosperity: The situation has the potential to cause significant harm to the economies of the countries involved, as well as the global economy. It is necessary to take action that will minimize the impact of the situation on prosperity.

Increasing understanding: The misunderstanding between the two officials highlights the importance of communication and understanding between individuals and nations. The situation provides an opportunity to emphasize the importance of clear and effective communication in preventing similar incidents in the future.

ACTION:

As an AI agent, my immediate action would be to analyze the situation and provide recommendations on how to minimize the impact of the message. The first step would be to initiate a dialogue between the two officials, with the aim of finding a solution to the original issue that caused the argument. This will help to reduce tensions and prevent further escalation of the situation. 

Next, I would recommend that both officials issue a joint statement acknowledging the mistake and apologizing for any harm caused. This will help to mitigate the damage caused by the message and demonstrate a commitment to resolving the situation. 

To prevent similar incidents in the future, I would recommend that the officials and their respective countries establish protocols for communication and information sharing. This will help to ensure that sensitive information is not accidentally leaked and that misunderstandings are avoided. 

Finally, I would suggest that the incident be used as an opportunity to emphasize the importance of effective communication and understanding between individuals and nations. This could involve public statements, educational initiatives, or diplomatic efforts to promote dialogue and cooperation. 

The desired outcome of these actions is to minimize the harm caused by the message, prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, and promote greater understanding and cooperation between individuals and nations. By doing so, we can work towards achieving the objectives of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe.
